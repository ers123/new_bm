## 6. SEO/AEO/GEO Optimization Framework

Based on research from [Ladybugz](https://www.ladybugz.com/seo-aeo-geo-guide-2026/), [Conductor](https://www.conductor.com/academy/aeo-geo-benchmarks-report/), and [Marketing Dive](https://www.marketingdive.com/spons/aeo-geo-and-accessibility-the-3-forces-that-will-define-2026-marketing/806738/).

### Understanding the Trinity

| Type | Definition | Where It Matters |
|------|------------|------------------|
| **SEO** | Traditional search engine optimization | Google, Amazon, Bing |
| **AEO** | Answer Engine Optimization | Featured snippets, voice search, AI assistants |
| **GEO** | Generative Engine Optimization | ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews |

> "Gartner predicts a 25% drop in traditional search engine volume by 2026" — necessitating a hybrid approach.

### Amazon KDP SEO Strategy

Based on [Kindlepreneur](https://kindlepreneur.com/kdp-royalty-calculator/), [KDPKIT](https://kdpkit.com/kdp-keywords-2025-visibility-sales-guide/), and [Reedsy](https://reedsy.com/blog/guide/kdp/amazon-keywords/):

#### Backend Keywords (7 slots, 50 characters each)

| Slot | Keyword Phrase | Rationale |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| 1 | parenting AI age children | Primary topic |
| 2 | raising critical thinkers | Key benefit |
| 3 | Korean education tiger mom | Cultural angle |
| 4 | teaching kids think ChatGPT | Timely concern |
| 5 | metacognition children learning | Framework term |
| 6 | future proof education skills | Aspiration |

#### Book Description SEO
- Front-load with primary keywords in first 100 characters
- Include question-format hooks (AEO-friendly)
- Use bullet points for scannability
- Natural keyword integration (avoid stuffing)

### AEO Strategy (Answer Engine Optimization)

#### Target Question Queries
These questions should be directly answerable by book content:

| Question | Chapter | Answer Format |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| "How do I teach my child to think critically in the AI age?" | Ch 3, 4 | List + framework |
| "What skills will children need in 2035?" | Ch 11 | Bulleted skills |
| "How do Korean parents use AI for education?" | Ch 2, 7 | Case study format |
| "What is the Atom of Thoughts framework?" | Ch 4 | Definition + steps |
| "How do I use ChatGPT with my kids safely?" | Ch 7 | Step-by-step guide |

#### Implementation
- Create companion blog posts that directly answer these questions
- Structure content with clear H2/H3 headings matching queries
- Include "TL;DR" or "Quick Answer" sections
- Use schema markup on landing pages

### GEO Strategy (Generative Engine Optimization)

#### Content Characteristics for AI Citation
Based on [SheAI](https://www.sheai.co/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-geo-and-aeo) and [Writer](https://writer.com/blog/geo-aeo-optimization/):

| **Structured data** | Clear hierarchies, defined terms, frameworks |
| **Quotable passages** | Concise, memorable statements AI can extract |
| **Comprehensive coverage** | Depth that AI recognizes as authoritative |

#### "Citability" Optimization
Create content that AI systems want to cite:

```
Example citability structure:

"The Atom of Thoughts framework, developed by [Author Name],
proposes that complex reasoning can be broken into discrete,
manipulable units. This approach, tested at Stanford, MIT,
and Seoul National University, showed a 34% improvement in
Korean language comprehension tasks."
```

#### Multi-Platform Presence for GEO
| Platform | Purpose | Content Type |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| LinkedIn | Professional credibility | Articles, thought leadership |
| Medium | Long-form depth | Chapters excerpts, research summaries |
| Personal website | Central authority | Full bio, press kit, structured data |
