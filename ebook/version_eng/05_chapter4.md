# Chapter 4: The AI Campus Revolution

## The Future My College Nephew Showed Me

Fall 2024, my nephew Jihoon, who attends Yonsei University, came home for Chuseok. Over coffee after dinner, I asked:

"How's college life these days? Are classes interesting?"

Jihoon opened his laptop and smiled.

"Uncle, it's completely different from when you went to college. Want to see?"

On screen was a list of apps he was using.

**Claude**: "I put in lecture recordings and it summarizes the key content. I only re-listen to the parts I don't understand."

**Notion AI**: "I use it for group project brainstorming. It's perfect for organizing and structuring ideas."

**Elicit**: "It's a paper search AI. Put in keywords and it finds related papers and summarizes them too. Essential for term papers."

**ChatGPT**: "Well, this is basic..."

I couldn't hide my surprise.

"Do your professors allow it?"

"It depends on the professor. Professor Park in the business school says 'Don't use AI, think for yourself,' but honestly everyone secretly uses it. But Professor Kim in sociology is the complete opposite. From day one she said, 'Actively use AI, but cite sources and critically verify.' That class is way more interesting."

"What's different?"

"Professor Park's class is still PowerPoint slides while explaining theory, and we take notes... But Professor Kim makes us learn theory with AI beforehand, and in class we only discuss. We debate topics like 'ethics of digital platform labor' for 2 hours straight. Totally fun."

Jihoon continued.

"And for our generation, AI is just a tool. Like your generation using Google. But adults seem to see AI as something special, something scary. To us it's just 'a smarter search engine.'"

In that moment I realized: I had no idea the generational gap was this wide.

## A Quiet Revolution Is Happening

Jihoon wasn't special. In 2024, a quiet revolution is happening on college campuses.

Seoul National University Central Library, a Tuesday afternoon at 3 PM. I observed students studying.

**Table A, 3rd year law student**:
Case book open, taking notes on a tablet. Looking closer, an AI app is auto-summarizing case issues. The student reads the summary and asks AI questions. "What's the difference between this case and Supreme Court Decision 2023Do1234?"

**Table B, 2nd year economics students (group of 4)**:
Group project in progress. But they're not dividing up reading materials. Instead, they have AI summarize the latest research in their areas of interest, then compare and discuss those summaries. "This research says X, but that research says Y. Why the difference?"

**Table C, 4th year engineering student**:
Coding graduation project. ChatGPT window open next to it. When errors occur, copies and pastes error messages. AI explains causes and solutions. Student understands, applies, moves to next step.

What's amazing is how natural all this is. Like us using calculators.

But what was even more surprising came next. I asked a student:

"If AI tells you all the answers, don't you not need to study yourself?"

That student, Soyeon, a 3rd year psychology major, smiled and answered:

"That's a misconception. AI doesn't give answers—it quickly resolves questions. Before, if I wondered 'What is this concept?' I'd search textbooks, Google, flip through papers—30 minutes. Now I ask AI and find out in 1 minute. Then I spend that time on deeper questions. Like 'How does this theory apply to Korean society?'"

"Does that count as studying?"

"Actually it works better. Rote memorization decreased, but depth of understanding deepened. My professor says 'Your generation asks much sharper questions.'"

## The Job Market's Wants Have Already Changed

But the real reason this change matters is something else.

Summer 2024, a new question appeared in Samsung Electronics new hire interviews:

"Have you solved any problems using AI tools?"

At Kakao intern interviews, this assignment appeared:

"Use ChatGPT to draft a marketing proposal in 30 minutes. However, submit the AI usage process and limitations together."

What's happening?

Companies already know: The talent needed in the AI era isn't 'people who can use AI' but 'people who can work better with AI.'

I had coffee with a senior who does HR at Naver. He said:

"Among new hires these days, almost no one can't use AI. That's not the issue. It's people who copy-paste AI's answers as-is vs. people who use AI as a springboard to create more creative results. This difference is huge. And that difference starts being made in college."

"How do you distinguish?"

"We ask in interviews: 'How did you utilize AI in this project?' Some applicants just say 'I asked ChatGPT.' Some applicants explain: 'I made 3 drafts with ChatGPT, analyzed each one's pros and cons, then combined Plan A's structure with Plan B's data and applied Plan C's tone to make the final version.' Who do you think we hire?"

It was clear.

And he added:

"What's interesting is, kids who use AI well usually have good teamwork too. Because they don't depend on AI—they use AI like a 'teammate.' So they cooperate well with actual teammates too."

## 'Learning How to Learn'—What's That?

I interviewed a Korea University education professor. She used the term "Meta-Learning."

I asked honestly:

"Meta-learning? That's a difficult term. Could you explain it simply?"

The professor smiled and answered:

"It's simple. 'Studying how to study.' Let me give an example. Old students said 'I learned calculus.' Today's students say 'I learned which methods work effectively for me when learning calculus.' See the difference?"

"Um... one is 'content' and one is 'process'?"

"Exactly. In the AI era, content can be found anytime. What matters is 'how to find it, how to understand it, how to use it.' That's meta-learning."

The professor gave an example.

"In my class there's a student named Minjun. At the start of the semester, he just took notes on class content. But after midterms he said 'Professor, I don't know why I don't understand.' "

"So?"

"I asked: 'How did you study?' The student answered: 'I read my notes.' So I asked again: 'What did you do while reading?' '...I read.' This student didn't know 'how to study.'"

"What did you do?"

"I had this student write a 'learning journal.' Study 30 minutes daily and record like this:
- What did I learn today?
- What did I understand?
- What didn't I understand?
- How will I solve what I don't understand?
- Was today's learning method effective?"

"Did it work?"

"It was amazing. 3 weeks later this student came to me. 'Professor, I get it now. I don't understand just by reading, but I understand when I draw it as a picture or explain it to someone else.' That's meta-learning. Discovering your own learning style."

And AI accelerates this meta-learning, she said.

"Minjun now uses AI to match his learning style. Like 'Explain this concept as an infographic.' AI creates customized learning materials for him."

## Sungkyunkwan University Students' Experiment

A study group in Sungkyunkwan University's business school did an interesting experiment.

They solved the same assignment three different ways.

**Method 1 - Traditional**: Go to library, find books, read papers, organize yourself.
**Method 2 - AI-Dependent**: Ask ChatGPT "Write me a report on this topic."
**Method 3 - AI Collaborative**: Use AI step-by-step.

Results?

**Method 1**: Time 12 hours, Report grade B+, Team satisfaction "Exhausting but felt like we learned"

**Method 2**: Time 30 minutes, Report grade C, Team satisfaction "Easy but learned nothing"

**Method 3**: Time 4 hours, Report grade A, Team satisfaction "Efficient while learning a lot"

Method 3's specific process was:

1. **Topic Brainstorming (30 min)**: Team members share ideas, ask AI "Evaluate these topics' novelty and feasibility." Select final topic referencing AI feedback.

2. **Research (1 hour)**: Ask AI "Find 5 key arguments on this topic." Team members each research AI's suggested arguments more deeply.

3. **Structuring (1 hour)**: Have AI summarize researched content, team members discuss report structure based on it.

4. **Draft Writing (1 hour)**: Generate section drafts with AI. Team members rewrite their assigned sections in their own language and deepen.

5. **Review and Revision (30 min)**: Have AI critique entire report. "Any logical gaps?", "Where's evidence weak?" Make final revisions referencing AI feedback.

Study group leader Seoyeon said:

"We actually learned more using AI. Because when AI gives a draft, we critically review it. 'Is this right?', 'What's the evidence for this claim?', 'Are there other perspectives?' We keep asking these questions. Before we just accepted things."

## Ewha Womans University's 'Flipped Classroom'

Ewha Womans University sociology professor Kim Minjeong completely changed her teaching method starting in 2024.

**Traditional Method (Until 2023)**:
- Class time: Professor lectures 90 min
- Assignment: Read and summarize textbook
- Assessment: Midterm, final exams

**AI-Utilizing Method (From 2024)**:
- Before class: Students learn basic concepts with AI (required)
- Class time: Discussion and projects 90 min
- Assignment: Apply theory to actual social problems
- Assessment: Process-focused (participation, depth of thinking)

Interview with Professor Kim:

"I was anxious at first. 'What if students study carelessly with AI and come?' But it was the opposite. They came better prepared."

"Why's that?"

"Because students quickly grasp basic concepts with AI, they can ask higher-order questions in class. Before they'd ask 'What is socialization?' Now they ask 'How is SNS changing the socialization process?'"

"Did classroom atmosphere change?"

"Completely. I'm not unilaterally teaching—we're exploring together with students. Yesterday in class a student asked 'Does AI also experience socialization?' We discussed that question for an hour. That's real learning."

And an interesting fact:

"Midterm average scores rose 15 points from last year. Plus 'this class was beneficial' survey responses jumped from 68% to 91%. Students say 'Finally a class where we think instead of memorize.'"

## Local University Student Jaeseok's Comeback

Hanyang University ERICA Campus. Computer science senior Jaeseok had a GPA of 3.2—not high. He kept getting rejected at large company document screenings.

But in summer 2024, Jaeseok got accepted as a Naver intern. Competition ratio 50:1.

What was the secret? I had coffee with him and asked.

"Portfolio. My grades are low, but I've made many projects."

"What projects?"

"Last year I made a 'campus restaurant recommendation chatbot' with AI. Posted it on the school community and 3,000 people used it. I put that in my portfolio."

"How did you make that? Alone?"

"With ChatGPT. I can't code perfectly. But if I ask 'Tell me how to make a KakaoTalk chatbot with Python,' AI gives me code. I understand it, modify it, test it... when stuck I ask again."

"So your skills improved?"

"Tons. I'm self-taught, but AI is a 24-hour private tutor. And thanks to AI, 'learning by making' became possible. Before I had to study all the theory first then make something, but now if I want to make something I just start. I can ask AI what I don't know."

"What did you say in the interview?"

"The interviewer asked: 'Did you use AI?' I answered honestly: 'Yes, I used ChatGPT heavily. But I understood and modified every line of code, and actually launched a service used by 3,000 people.' Then the interviewer smiled and said: 'That's the right answer in the AI era. How well you utilize AI is your skill.'"

Jaeseok added:

"Friends with 4.0 GPAs also failed. But those friends only studied theory. Companies seem to want 'people who can make things.' Thanks to AI, people like me can grab opportunities too."

## What Will Future Universities Look Like

Finally, how will universities change 5 years from now?

I interviewed education experts and students and found patterns.

**Change 1 - Redefining the Lecture Hall**

Space where professors 'transmit' knowledge → Space where students 'explore' knowledge

A Hanyang University professor's words:
"My future role is 'person asking the best questions.' Questions AI can't answer, questions without right answers."

**Change 2 - Transformation of Assessment Methods**

Memorization exams → Process and thinking skills assessment

A Sogang University student's words:
"Classes where you 'cram and test' aren't popular anymore. Students think 'Why attend class when I can study with AI?' Popular classes are ones that 'make you think.'"

**Change 3 - Change in Degree Meaning**

Diploma = knowledge proof → Diploma = learning ability proof

A company HR manager's words:
"What we'll look at going forward isn't 'what you know' but 'how fast you learn.' Because needed knowledge keeps changing."

**Change 4 - University's Reason for Existence**

Knowledge provider → Network and experience provider

A Yonsei graduating senior's words:
"Honestly major knowledge can be learned on YouTube or AI too. But what you get from university isn't that. Professor mentoring, collaboration experience with classmates, networking with diverse people... you can't do that online."

## As Parents, What We Should Do

Finishing my conversation with nephew Jihoon, I thought:

By the time our children go to college, campuses will be completely different from now.

Then what should we prepare them for as parents?

**First, make AI familiar as a tool.**
Smart use, not prohibition. Not "Don't use AI" but "Try using AI this way."

**Second, teach 'how to learn.'**
Critical thinking, not rote memorization. Habitualize questions like "Is this right?", "Why?", "What's another way?"

**Third, don't let them fear failure.**
In the AI era, quick attempts and failures are learning. Not making perfect plans then starting, but making something first then revising.

**Fourth, enrich human experiences.**
Things AI can't do—making friends, team projects, volunteer work, travel... these experiences become more important.

**Fifth, nurture curiosity.**
AI gives answers, but humans ask questions. The ability to question is competitiveness.

That night, I asked my middle school daughter:

"What do you want to study in college?"

My daughter answered:

"I don't really know yet. But Dad, I'm curious about a lot of things. Why do people endure inequality and keep living? Is climate change really serious? Does artificial intelligence have consciousness? Things like that."

I smiled and said:

"That's enough. University isn't a place that gives you answers to your questions—it's a place that makes you ask better questions."

And I thought to myself:

By the time this child goes to college, AI will be even more advanced. But her curiosity, critical thinking, empathy... these will still be—no, even more—precious.

What we should prepare isn't fear of change but flexibility to enjoy change.

That's the best gift we can give our children who will live in the AI era.
