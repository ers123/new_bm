### **Chapter 5: AI Literacy—The New Essential Skill**

#### **Why AI Literacy Could Be as Fundamental as Reading**

I can't forget the moment when my older daughter, at age seven, asked me what she wanted to be when she grew up. "But how do I prepare for something that doesn't even exist yet?" Her question pinpointed my dilemma as a parent. In a world where specific job requirements can change dramatically over the course of a career, how can we equip our children with skills that will remain relevant across time?

AI pioneer Andrew Ng puts it this way: "Today we take for granted that many people know how to read and write. I hope someday it will be just as common for people to know how to write code, especially code for AI."

This isn't simply a technical prophecy. Hundreds of years ago, reading and writing were privileges reserved for clergy and nobility. The idea that everyone should learn to read was radical for its time. But as civilization advanced, literacy became the central axis of economic, social, and civic participation. Today we can't imagine navigating the modern world without the ability to read and write.

AI literacy is following a similar transformative path. What was once the exclusive domain of experts is gradually becoming basic competency for meaningful participation in a world where AI is ubiquitous. This doesn't mean everyone needs to become an AI researcher—it means that the ability to understand the nature of AI systems, collaborate creatively with them, and critically evaluate their outputs could become as essential as today's reading and writing.

As parents, we've arrived at a time when we must explore a new dimension of literacy beyond the traditional three R's of reading, writing, and arithmetic—one that includes algorithmic thinking, data interpretation, and creative collaboration with AI systems. What's hopeful is that these new forms of literacy can be cultivated gradually through experiential approaches suited to children's developmental stages.

#### **Korean-Style AI Literacy: What Our Children Need**

In Korea's education field, AI literacy has already begun. Starting in 2025, with the expansion of information education in elementary, middle, and high schools and the introduction of AI digital textbooks, our children will experience a learning environment different from previous generations. At an elementary school in Seoul, students practice English conversation using AI chatbots, and at a middle school in Gyeonggi Province, AI analyzes each student's math learning progress and provides customized problems.

But school AI education alone isn't enough. The role of the home is even more important. When a child becomes curious about YouTube's recommendation algorithm, when they marvel at how a smart speaker understands speech—those moments are the golden time for cultivating AI literacy.

I remember when my second child started showing curiosity about coding. Among countless programming languages and platforms, I felt overwhelmed about where to start. Andrew Ng's AI career development framework provides clear direction for parents like us. He presents the natural developmental process toward AI proficiency in three stages.

#### **A Three-Step Path to AI Fluency**

##### **Stage 1: Learning Foundational Skills**

Just as children learn the alphabet, AI learners must embody foundational competencies. This includes basic machine learning concepts (how computers learn through data), programming basics (languages like Python), and mathematical thinking (logical problem-solving and pattern recognition).

Ng offers reassuring words: "No one can rush to acquire everything they need to know in a weekend or a month. Every person I know who excels at machine learning is a lifelong learner."

This means we don't need to push children into intensive technical training from early childhood. Instead, we can focus on planting seeds of intellectual curiosity and cultivating intrinsic motivation for continuous learning.

**For elementary students**:
- Build computational thinking with block coding like Entry or Scratch
- Practice logical reasoning with board games like "checkers" or "Rummikub"
- Find AI in daily life: from "Siri, what's the weather today?" to Netflix recommendations

**For middle schoolers**:
- Get started with Python through Code.org or Khan Academy
- Make simple image classification AI with Teachable Machine
- Connect statistics and probability to real-life data

**For high schoolers**:
- Challenge beginner Kaggle competitions
- Collaborate on AI projects in school clubs or online communities
- Learn data analysis basics

Throughout this entire process, building comfort and confidence should take priority over technical mastery.

##### **Stage 2: Working on Projects**

Once basic literacy is internalized, creative practice through actual projects becomes the crucial next step. Ng advises, "Don't worry about starting too small." One of his first machine learning research projects was mimicking the sin(x) function with neural networks. Though not particularly useful practically, he says it was a valuable learning experience that enabled him to move toward greater intellectual adventures.

When my daughter first stepped into the world of coding, she made a simple program that displayed her name on screen in various colors. Though technically basic, the sense of accomplishment from creating something that actually worked gave her the courage to approach increasingly complex challenges.

**Project ideas for Korean children**:

*Elementary students*:
- "Recognize My Dog's Expressions" AI (using Teachable Machine)
- "Our Neighborhood Waste Sorting Helper" chatbot

*Middle schoolers*:
- K-POP dance move recognition program
- School lunch menu rating prediction AI (using school data)

*High schoolers*:
- Korean spelling checker improvement project
- Local fine dust prediction model

The key is balancing each project to be challenging enough to promote growth while not so excessively difficult it causes frustration.

##### **Stage 3: Finding the Right Environment**

The final stage of Ng's framework is discovering a nurturing learning ecosystem that encourages and supports continuous learning and growth in AI literacy.

"Choose your collaborators carefully," Ng advises. "Because we're deeply influenced by those around us, the power peers have on our growth is truly enormous."

**Learning environments available in Korea**:

- **School clubs**: Informatics Olympiad prep groups, robotics clubs, maker clubs
- **Local institutions**: AI education programs at regional creative invention education centers and science museums
- **Online communities**: Naver Cafe "Playing with Coding," "Python Lounge," etc.
- **Vacation programs**: University-affiliated gifted education centers, summer/winter camps at SW-centered universities
- **Competitions and events**: Software Sharing Festival, Junior Software Creative Competition

As my daughter's interest in coding deepened, we discovered a local girls coding club. The emphasis there wasn't on who could write the most sophisticated code, but on helping each participant develop their own unique technical competencies and creative confidence.

#### **[Practical Guide] AI Literacy in Daily Life: 3 Habits to Share as a Family**

Family activities to help children develop the habit of critically understanding AI rather than blindly trusting it.

**1. "Why?" Dinnertime Discussions**

Once a week, set aside time for family members to share one AI experience from the week.

*Mom*: "This week the navigation recommended a different route than usual, and it turned out there was an accident. How did the AI know?"

*High school daughter*: "Instagram Reels keeps showing me diet ads. Does it remember what I searched for?"

*Elementary son*: "My friend did homework with ChatGPT. Is that okay?"

→ Through this conversation, children naturally think about **how algorithms work, data privacy, and ethical use**.

**2. Creating an AI Error Notebook**

An activity to collect experiences where AI gave wrong answers. Record them in a notebook or Notion page.

```
Date: March 15, 2025
Question: "Did King Sejong wear glasses?"
AI Answer: "Yes, King Sejong wore glasses because he read so much his eyesight deteriorated."
Fact Check: Glasses came to Korea after the Japanese invasions. There were no glasses in King Sejong's era.
Lesson Learned: AI can be wrong too. Historical facts need cross-verification.
```

→ As children discover and record AI's limitations themselves, **critical thinking skills** naturally develop.

**3. Once a Month, Learning AI Together**

Time for parents and children to learn a new AI tool together.

- **March**: Read English picture books together using Google Translate (find awkward translation parts)
- **April**: Make a family travel poster with AI art tools (DALL-E, Midjourney)
- **May**: Ask ChatGPT for family recipes and compare with Mom's recipes

→ Parents don't need to know everything perfectly first. **The process of learning together, making mistakes together, and discovering together** itself shows children a model of "lifelong learner."

---

**Tips for Parents**:

The key is for these activities to shed the heaviness of "AI education" and proceed as natural extensions of daily conversation. If your child loses interest, don't force it. What matters is cultivating a **balanced attitude of not fearing AI while not blindly trusting it either**.

AI literacy isn't completed overnight. Like learning to read and write, it's a journey of growing together slowly but steadily over time. And that journey is most enjoyable and meaningful when families share it together.
