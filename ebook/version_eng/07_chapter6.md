### **Chapter 6: A Parent's Guide to Supporting Tech Careers**

#### **How to Prepare for Jobs That Don't Have Names Yet**

When my older daughter came back from a high school career fair, her face held both excitement and confusion simultaneously. "Dad," she said, "the tech company recruiter said the most important jobs in five years probably don't even exist yet. How am I supposed to prepare for something without a name?"

Her question captures the fundamental challenge parents face today. In a technology ecosystem evolving at unprecedented speed, how can we guide our children toward meaningful and fulfilling professional journeys?

The traditional approach—identifying stable career paths and helping children acquire the specific skills needed for those paths—feels increasingly anachronistic. When job descriptions and required competencies can change dramatically within a few years, we need a new approach.

In this chapter, we'll explore practical strategies for parents navigating this new terrain. Our goal isn't to uniformly push all children into AI or tech careers. It's to ensure children with genuine interest and potential in these fields can maximize their capabilities, while helping all children acquire the basic technical literacy they'll need in the 21st century, regardless of their chosen field.

#### **Korea's Tech Career Environment: Voices from the Actual Field**

Korea's tech job market is rapidly changing. Not just major companies like Naver, Kakao, Samsung, and LG, but startups like Toss, Daangn Market, and Baedal Minjok are creating new types of jobs.

One of my friends works as an AI ethics officer at Kakao. When he majored in philosophy in college, his parents worried "Will you even get a job?" But now he analyzes bias in AI recommendation algorithms and creates policies to protect user privacy. His role combining philosophical thinking with technical understanding didn't exist 10 years ago.

To understand the tech career environment, I spoke with people actually working in the field.

**Naver AI Researcher Kim Jihyun (30s)**:
"I majored in computer science, but what helps most at the company is actually the psychology elective I took in undergrad. To understand how AI predicts people's behavior, you have to understand people."

**Toss Product Designer Park Minsu (20s)**:
"I went to art school. I learned coding after joining the company. What's important is the eye to discover user inconveniences. Technology is just a tool—defining problems is human sensibility."

**Startup Founder Lee Sujin (40s)**:
"Our company makes pet healthcare AI. Team members include veterinarians, data scientists, app developers, and marketers. More important than excelling in one field is being able to talk with people from different fields."

You can find commonality in their stories. **Success in tech comes not simply from coding skills, but from the ability to discover problems, empathy to understand people, and convergent thinking that connects diverse fields**.

#### **Korean Parents' Real Concerns: Stability vs. Innovation**

In consultations, I often hear unique concerns from Korean parents.

"I know AI has a future, but is it more stable than civil service or large companies?"

"My child is very interested in game development, but I hear game companies have intense overtime..."

"Aren't startups risky? Wouldn't it be better to go to Samsung or Hyundai?"

These worries are natural. In Korean society, a 'stable job' isn't simply an individual matter—it's connected to the well-being of the entire family. But the reality of the tech field differs from our existing concepts.

**A New Definition of Stability**

An acquaintance working in HR at Naver said this: "These days stability isn't 'working at one company for a long time' but 'becoming someone needed everywhere.' Because technology changes rapidly, what companies need in talent keeps changing too."

In fact, Korea's major IT companies are already experiencing this change:
- Naver reorganized while focusing on AI research
- Kakao changed its platform business structure multiple times
- Samsung Electronics is also expanding from semiconductors to AI and robotics

**So what should parents do?**

Rather than targeting specific companies or jobs, what's more important is cultivating **'adaptability' to create value in any environment**. This is the new era's 'stability.'

#### **3 Trends in the Evolving Tech Career Environment**

##### **1. From Specialists to Versatile Convergent Talent**

Traditionally, tech careers were clearly divided: developers, designers, planners, marketers. Each had their own domain. But now these boundaries are blurring.

**Real Case: Literature Girl Who Became a Game Planner**

There was a student who wrote novels in the high school literature club. Her parents worried "Can you make a living writing?" But that student went to college for game studies, and now works at Netmarble as a narrative designer writing game scenarios. She learned basic Unity usage so she can implement stories she writes directly in games.

"I'm not a coding expert. But I understand what developers are saying, and I can explain my ideas in their language. That's most important."

**Hybrid Jobs Getting Attention in the Korean Market**:
- **Healthcare AI Specialist**: Medical knowledge + data analysis (demand increasing at Seoul National University Hospital, Samsung Medical Center, etc.)
- **Edutech Planner**: Education + technical understanding (Daekyo, Chunjae Education, Megastudy, etc.)
- **AI Ethics Officer**: Philosophy/law + AI technology (Naver, Kakao, SK Telecom, etc.)
- **Digital Marketer**: Creation + data analysis (essential at all companies)

##### **2. Soft Skills Over Hard Skills**

It's an era where AI writes code and analyzes data. So what unique value remains for humans?

**Confession from a Google Korea Executive**

At a conference, a Google Korea executive said:
"Technical test scores are basic in interviews. What actually determines acceptance is 'Do we want to work with this person?' Can they easily explain complex problems to team members? Do they show respectful attitudes when collaborating with people from other departments? Do they respond calmly when unexpected bugs occur?"

**Soft Skills Korean Companies Look For**:
- **Communication**: Explaining technical terms easily to ordinary people
- **Collaboration**: Designers, planners, and developers working as one team
- **Problem-solving**: Creatively approaching problems without right answers
- **Resilience**: Mindset to try again after failure
- **Ethical judgment**: Considering technology's impact on society

For parents, this is an important lesson. **Just as much as coding hagwons, club activities where children learn to cooperate with friends, debate classes where they clearly express their thoughts, and sports activities where they experience and overcome failure all help prepare for tech careers.**

##### **3. Lifelong Learning as Part of the Job**

The biggest characteristic of the tech field is **'acceleration of learning cycles.'**

**Confession from a Startup CTO**

A fintech startup CTO said:
"I learned Java in college. At the company I had to use Python, and three years later I learned Kotlin. Last year I studied the GPT API, and now I'm learning cloud architecture. I don't use any of the specific technologies I learned in college. But I keep using 'how to quickly learn new things.'"

What does this mean for parents? **More important than mastering specific programming languages is 'the ability to learn how to learn.'**

- Courage to ask questions without being embarrassed about not knowing
- Habit of self-learning using YouTube, online lectures, and communities
- Perseverance to try other methods instead of giving up after failure

These 'meta-learning abilities' can be cultivated at home from childhood.

#### **[Practical Guide] 5-Step Dialogue Method to Connect Your Child's 'Passion' to Career**

Many parents ask: "My child isn't interested in coding—can they still go into tech?"

The answer is "yes." The tech field doesn't only need developers. You can start from what your child is passionate about now.

---

**Step 1: Observe What Your Child Really Likes**

Change the question.
- (X) "What do you want to do later?"
- (O) "What's most fun for you these days?"

**Real Cases**:
- Elementary daughter: "I really enjoy watching makeup reviews on YouTube"
- Middle school son: "I like playing League of Legends with friends"
- High school daughter: "Reading webtoons. Especially romantic fantasy!"

---

**Step 2: Find 'Tech Jobs' in That Field Together**

Search your child's favorite field + "jobs" or "what they do" on Naver or YouTube.

**If your child likes cosmetics**:
- **Data scientist** who makes cosmetics ingredient databases (Hwahae, Glowpick apps)
- **AR developer** who virtually tests cosmetics (L'Oréal, Amorepacific)
- **AI analyst** who analyzes customer reviews

**If your child likes games**:
- **Narrative designer** who writes game stories
- **Concept artist** who designs characters
- **Data analyst** who adjusts game balance
- **Product designer** who designs game UI/UX

**If your child likes webtoons**:
- **Service planner** who makes webtoon platforms (Naver Webtoon, Kakao Page)
- **AI developer** who develops tools that draw backgrounds with AI
- **Content analyst** who analyzes reader data

→ Through this process, children realize "What I like can connect with technology too."

---

**Step 3: Show 'Real Work' Through YouTube or Blogs**

Job titles alone don't feel real. Watch vlogs or interviews of people actually doing that work together.

**Recommended YouTube Channels**:
- Search "developer vlog" → Real developer's day
- "UX designer vlog" → Designer's work process
- "Planner daily life" → Service planning process

→ Parents watch together and exclaim "Wow, they do more diverse work than I thought!" The child's interest increases.

---

**Step 4: Create 'Tasting' Experience with Small Project**

Start with "Want to try it with Mom/Dad?" instead of "Want to try it?"

**With child interested in cosmetics**:
→ "Shall we organize our home cosmetics ingredient lists in Excel? Let's make a graph of which ingredients are most common"
→ Tools: Google Spreadsheet, Excel

**With child who likes games**:
→ "Shall we make our family characters? Let's make a simple game with Scratch"
→ Tools: Scratch, Roblox Studio

**With child who likes webtoons**:
→ "Shall we ask AI to make a webtoon story about our family? Then draw the pictures ourselves"
→ Tools: ChatGPT, Canva

→ The key is experiencing **the fun of the 'making process,' not perfect results**.

---

**Step 5: Observe Child's Reaction and Decide Next Steps**

After trying the project, observe your child's reaction.

**Type A - "Wow, this is fun! I want to do more"**
→ Look for related clubs, online lectures, experience camps
→ Apply for related career experience during school free semester

**Type B - "Hmm... it's harder than I thought"**
→ Don't push forcibly. Wrap up with "At least now you know what it's like, right?"
→ Try again with a different field after a few months

**Type C - "Making isn't for me, I just like using it"**
→ That's okay too! Being good at 'utilizing' technology is also an important capability
→ Later you can go into careers like planner, marketer, consultant

**Reality Advice for Parents: A New Perspective on Stability**

"But aren't large companies still more stable?"

Of course large companies like Samsung, Naver, and Kakao are still good options. But what's important is **not the company name, but what work you do there**.

Even at large companies, your job changes every 3-5 years and you must learn new technologies. Even at startups, if you grow rapidly you can build a stable career. (Baedal Minjok, Toss, and Daangn Market all started as startups.)

Real stability isn't "entering a good company" but **"becoming someone needed everywhere."** To do that:

1. **Convergent thinking connecting technology + other fields**
2. **Ability to collaborate and communicate with people**
3. **Learning agility to quickly learn new things**

If children have these three things, they can adapt well to any change.

And most of all, **let your child do work they truly love.** People doing work they love ultimately do it longest, best, and happiest. That's real 'stability.'
