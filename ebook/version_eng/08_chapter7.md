### **Chapter 7: Navigating AI Ethics as a Family**

#### **An Ethics Discussion That Started at the Dinner Table**

Last month, my thirteen-year-old son came home deeply troubled after a class discussion about AI-generated content. "Dad," he asked during dinner, "is getting AI help with homework cheating? My teacher says it is, but then the teacher uses AI to make our worksheets. That seems unfair."

My son's question triggered one of our family's most interesting and profound conversations.

My fifteen-year-old daughter argued that using AI for homework isn't fundamentally different from using calculators for math. "The tool handles the mechanical aspects, and humans do the creative thinking."

In contrast, my ten-year-old youngest countered that AI is a fundamentally different dimension of tool because it can create entire essays beyond simple calculations.

My wife, drawing on her experience as an educator, expressed concern: "Can children who depend on AI develop the same thinking skills as children who exercise their cognitive muscles solving assignments independently?"

This dinner table discussion was a microcosm of the ethical questions families worldwide are facing as AI seeps ever deeper into daily life. Unlike previous technological transitions, AI is simultaneously transforming the essence of education, the meaning of entertainment, and the authenticity of social interaction.

Children aren't passively preparing for future careers. Rather, they're building complex relationships with these new intellectual companions right now, often before parents and educators can provide clear ethical compasses.

As parents, we can't rely on existing moral norms or our own childhood experiences. But amid this uncertainty, families play a more crucial role than any institution in helping children develop ethical frameworks for healthy and meaningful relationships with AI technology.

In this chapter, we'll explore the ethical questions families face in the AI era and approaches to navigate them together. Our goal isn't to provide absolute answers to every ethical dilemma, but to help families engage deeply with these questions to make intentional and reflective choices.

#### **Beyond Rules: Developing Ethical Reasoning Abilities**

When facing new technological challenges, parents often instinctively seek clear boundaries. Rules like no screen time after 8 PM, no social media until age 13, absolutely no AI use for homework.

These rules provide clarity and safe boundaries that both parents and children need amid uncertainty. But rules alone are fundamentally insufficient for navigating AI's complex and constantly changing ethical terrain.

The limits of rule-based approaches become even clearer when considering how rapidly AI capabilities evolve. Today's rules can become obsolete or even counterproductive as new features emerge. More fundamentally, rigid rules can hinder children from developing the ethical reasoning abilities they need to make sound judgments in new situations.

A wiser approach integrates appropriate boundary-setting with ongoing ethical dialogue that helps children develop their own moral compass. This approach recognizes that today's children will face technological questions throughout their lives that we can't even imagine.

#### **From Compliance to Competence: The Journey of Ethical Maturity**

Young children naturally start with rule-following as part of development, but true maturity requires gradually internalizing those principles deeply and cultivating independent ethical judgment abilities.

AI ethics offers a special opportunity to support this developmental journey. Instead of simply establishing rigid rules about technology use, parents can engage children in discussions about the deep principles behind those rules, gradually transferring responsibility for moral judgment as children demonstrate ethical maturity.

In our family, we've found that reframing technology guidelines as 'training wheels for learning' helps children understand their developmental purpose tremendously.

When my older daughter first started using AI writing tools for school projects, we set clear, specific guidelines together for ethical use. Help during brainstorming and editing processes was considered creative collaboration, but having AI generate entire assignments undermined the essence of learning.

As my daughter consistently showed deep, thoughtful judgment about these ethical boundaries over time, we gradually transitioned from a relationship of unilaterally imposing rules to a partnership relationship of consulting on decisions together.

#### **An Ethical Reasoning Framework for Families**

Several systematic frameworks become valuable tools for families to structure ethical conversations about AI in age-appropriate yet profound ways.

##### **The Three Questions Framework: An Ethical Compass for Young Children**

For young children, a simple yet powerful three-question framework provides an accessible starting point for ethical reasoning.

- **Is it honest?** Does this technology use involve deception or misrepresentation?
- **Is it helpful?** Does this technology use support genuine learning and creative growth?
- **Is it kind?** Does this technology use respect others and avoid harm?

These questions are simple enough for elementary students to understand while having comprehensiveness to address a surprising number of ethical concerns.

When my youngest daughter asked if she could use an AI art generator for a school art project, we explored these three questions carefully together.

"Can you honestly tell your teacher how you made the image?" "Will making images this way help you learn the artistic skills and creative thinking the assignment was designed to develop?" "Is using AI respectful of other classmates' efforts who are working hard drawing by hand?"

This conversation didn't lead to a simple yes or no answer, but rather evolved into a more nuanced and creative approach: using AI tools to generate initial inspiration and ideas, then drawing her own original artwork based on those creative seeds, and transparently explaining her entire creative process to the teacher.

##### **Stakeholder Analysis: Thinking Within Networks**

For older children and teenagers, stakeholder analysis provides a more sophisticated framework for ethical reasoning.

- **Who is affected by this decision?** (the student themselves, teachers, classmates, future employers, etc.)
- **How is each stakeholder affected?** (benefits gained, potential harms)
- **What moral responsibilities do we have to each stakeholder?** (honesty, fairness, respect)
- **How can we wisely balance conflicting interests?**

When my son's debate team considered using AI to develop arguments for a competition, stakeholder analysis helped them explore ethical implications in multiple layers.

They carefully identified impacts on team members (potential reduction in developing important research and thinking skills), opposing teams (concerns about fair competition), judges (expectations for original and authentic work), and the educational purpose of the debate activity itself.

This comprehensive analysis led them to establish balanced team guidelines: allowing AI use during initial research and brainstorming stages, but requiring human development and refinement of core arguments, and fully transparently documenting how AI tools were used.

##### **Values Clarification Approach: Setting the Family's Moral Compass**

When making family-level decisions about AI technology, the values clarification approach plays a key role in meaningfully aligning technological choices with the family's deeper priorities.

- **What are the core values most precious to our family?** (genuine learning, creative growth, honesty, etc.)
- **How might this technology support or undermine those values?**
- **What boundaries or practices would help ensure technology use aligns with our values?**

This approach is based on the important recognition that ethical decisions about technology don't have universal right answers, but must deeply reflect each family's unique values.

Through deep reflection, our family identified creativity, critical thinking, and meaningful human connection as core values. This values clarification guided us to set consistent and meaningful technological boundaries: actively encouraging creative uses of technology while limiting passive content consumption, ensuring balanced space for both digital and non-digital interactions, and promoting deep critical engagement instead of uncritical acceptance of AI-generated content.

#### **[Practical Guide] Building Our Family's Digital Values**

Conversation cards for discussing difficult ethical issues at children's eye level and creating our family's healthy technology use culture.

##### **Weekend Dinner Discussion Cards: Korean Family Version**

Once a week during dinner, draw one card and discuss it as a family. There are no right answers. The process itself of listening to each other's thoughts and pondering together is valuable.

| **Situation Card** | **Questions to Discuss** |
|---|---|
| **I submitted art homework with an AI-drawn picture** | • Is this cheating or using a new tool?<br>• How is it different from solving math problems with a calculator?<br>• Should I tell the teacher "I used AI"? |
| **YouTube keeps showing me diet ads** | • How did YouTube know I want to lose weight?<br>• Is it okay for my information to be used without my knowledge?<br>• Can these recommendations influence my thinking? |
| **My friend wrote a book report with ChatGPT** | • Can I do that too?<br>• Is it okay if the teacher doesn't know?<br>• Where's the boundary between getting AI help and having AI write it? |
| **When I asked AI to draw a firefighter, only men appeared** | • Why did AI only draw male firefighters?<br>• How might seeing AI like this continuously affect our thinking?<br>• Is there a way we can make AI fairer? |
| **I found a celebrity who looks like me using a face recognition app** | • Where does this app store my face photo?<br>• Could it be used elsewhere without my permission?<br>• What's the limit on giving personal information for fun? |
| **I only watch news recommended by AI** | • What's the problem with only watching news I want to see?<br>• Should I also listen to people with different thoughts?<br>• How can I escape the filter bubble? |

##### **How Parents Can Lead the Conversation**

When using discussion cards, start like this:

**1. Start with Open Questions**
- (X) "That's bad. Don't do it"
- (O) "What do you think is right to do in this situation?"

**2. Listen to Your Child's Thoughts First**
- (X) "Mom/Dad will tell you"
- (O) "Why did you think that? Can you tell me more?"

**3. Ponder Together Instead of Giving Right Answers**
- (X) "The right answer is this"
- (O) "Hmm, that seems right too, but what about this case?"

**4. Connect to Real Experiences**
- "Have we as a family experienced a similar situation?"
- "What if your close friend did this?"

##### **Creating Family Digital Rules: Our Home's Promises**

After several conversations with discussion cards, make your own family digital rules together. What's important is **not parents deciding unilaterally, but all family members creating and agreeing together**.

**Our Home's Digital Promises (Example)**

```
1. Think by yourself first before getting AI help
   • Homework: Ponder alone for at least 15 minutes before asking AI
   • Reason: Because practicing thinking is important

2. Be honest if you used AI
   • Tell the teacher if you used AI for school assignments
   • Reason: Because honesty is our family value

3. Use 30 minutes of screen time as 'creating time'
   • Not just watching YouTube, but creative activities like making videos or drawing
   • Reason: Because we want to be creators, not just consumers

4. After 8 PM on weekends is family time
   • Gather all devices at the living room charging station
   • Reason: Because we want to talk looking at each other's faces, not smartphones

5. One 'Digital Detox Day' per month
   • Spend one Saturday without smartphones, computers, or TV
   • Reason: Because we want to remember life without digital is fun enough too
```

→ Write these promises nicely on A4 paper and stick them on the refrigerator, then check together at family meetings every 3 months: "Are these rules being followed well?", "Is there anything to change?"

##### **Making a 'Digital Device Charging Station': The Power of Physical Boundaries**

Visible physical devices greatly help change family digital habits.

**Materials**:
- 1 power strip
- 1 pretty basket or box
- Small memo pad and pen

**Installation Method**:
1. Place the charging basket in one corner of the living room or entryway
2. At 8 PM, all family members put smartphones and tablets in the charging station
3. Place a memo pad next to the basket and before bed, write one line "What I want to say to my family today" and post it

**Effects**:
- Instead of each person watching smartphones in their rooms during evening, everyone gathers in the living room
- Instead of "Mom, can I look at my smartphone?" conversations start with "This happened at school today"
- Children naturally develop habits of reading books, playing board games, or talking with family

**Final Advice: It's Okay Not to Be Perfect**

You don't need to practice all of this perfectly. Some days you'll break rules, some days it'll feel too bothersome to pull out discussion cards.

What matters isn't **perfect ethical boundaries** but **the process itself of pondering together and growing together**.

AI ethics isn't completed with one conversation. As children grow, as technology advances, our family must keep learning and adjusting. If we take that journey as a family, that alone is meaningful enough.

Perhaps the greatest gift we can give our children is this message: **"There are no right answers. But we can find better answers by pondering together."** And that might be the ethical compass our children need most for living in the AI era.
