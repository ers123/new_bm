### **Chapter 8: Resetting Our Relationship with Technology**

#### **Beyond the Utopia-Dystopia Divide: A Thoughtful Conversation with Technology**

When our family gathered to watch the latest documentary about artificial intelligence, I discovered an interesting spectrum of human consciousness in each person's reaction. My teenage son's eyes lit up, mesmerized by the infinite horizons of technological possibility, dreaming of a future filled with unprecedented abundance and opportunity. Meanwhile, my wife, with a realist's sharp insight, carefully analyzed the looming shadows of job displacement, surveillance society, and deepening inequality. My youngest daughter, with the purest curiosity, posed an intuitive question: "Will robots eventually replace our teachers?"

These varied reactions within our family are a microcosm of the polarized conversations we commonly witness in modern society's discourse around AI. Popular narratives tend toward extreme binaries: AI is either the savior that will solve humanity's most fundamental challenges and open the door to a golden age, or it's Pandora's box that will undermine human ontological agency, deepen social contradictions, and potentially pose existential risks.

#### **The Psychological Mechanics of Binary Thinking**

The reason binary narratives about technology persist in dominating our collective consciousness is simple: they provide the clarity that the human mind craves when facing a complex and uncertain future. These narratives offer clear emotional responses (enthusiastic anticipation or existential dread) and straightforward prescriptions (accelerate development or impose strict limitations).

I vividly observed these cognitive dynamics in my family's AI discussions. When my children ask whether AI is 'good' or 'bad,' it's not simply curiosity—it's an instinct to organize complex phenomena into comprehensible frameworks. Binary frames are not only easy to understand, but also much easier to communicate to others and remember.

However, this convenience of simplification comes at considerable cost to accuracy and practical usefulness. Binary thinking obscures the contextual nature of technological impact, the spectrum-like diversity of potential outcomes, and the crucial role of human choice and social institutions in shaping technological trajectories.

Consider the recent controversy in Korea over using ChatGPT for learning. Some parents defined AI-assisted learning as a "danger that steals thinking ability," while others championed it as an "essential tool for future education." But the truly important question wasn't 'use it or not'—it was 'how to use it.' Having AI write homework is an entirely different matter from asking questions to help understand concepts.

#### **The Media Ecosystem and Korean Context**

Media coverage systematically amplifies binary narratives about technology. When our family encounters AI-related news, we consistently face stories tilted to extremes—headlines like "Naver AI, More Accurate Health Consultation Than Doctors" or "AI Automation Threatens 5 Million Korean Jobs."

These reports aren't necessarily factually inaccurate. It's true that certain AI systems outperform human experts in specific diagnostic tasks, and automation technology does pose a real threat to certain forms of employment. However, the cumulative effect of these fragmented reports persistently reinforces the extreme perception that AI is either a miraculous panacea or an existential catastrophe.

Korean society shows particularly extreme reactions when combined with its education fervor. Anxiety about "Will only my child fall behind?" leads to blind acceptance of AI educational tools, while on the opposite side, fear that "We'll lose our humanity" manifests as technology rejection. The nuanced middle ground between these extremes is rarely addressed.

#### **Historical Perspective: Technology Is Not Neutral, But Neither Is It Deterministic**

Looking back through history's long arc, transformative technologies have rarely been purely angelic or demonic. Rather, their impact has been determined by how human society chose to develop, deploy, and manage them.

The printing press became both a tool for knowledge democratization and propaganda. Electricity is the foundation of modern civilization while creating new forms of dependency. In the Korean context, the rapid spread of PC communications and the internet in the 1990s brought breakthrough improvements in information accessibility, but simultaneously birthed new social problems like cyberbullying and privacy violations. Early 2000s achievement of world's highest broadband internet penetration was a source of pride, but came with shadows of game addiction and online crime.

All these technologies brought both tremendous benefits and considerable challenges, and their ultimate outcomes were shaped not by technological determinism but by humanity's collective wisdom and choices.

AI will likely follow this historical pattern, and its ultimate impact will be determined more by the social, economic, political, and cultural contexts in which it develops and is applied than by the technology's inherent attributes. The real question isn't the simple binary of whether AI will be 'good' or 'bad' for humanity, but what kind of coexistence relationship we want to build with these innovative technologies.

#### **The Third Way: Toward Technological Maturity**

The Korean drama *Sky Castle* sharply reveals our society's polarized attitudes toward education—extremes of using any means necessary for success, and extremes of rejecting the entire system. But what we need in actual life is wise moderation between these poles.

The same applies to our relationship with AI. We must seek a third path that is neither uncritical acceptance of all innovation (technological optimism) nor reflexive rejection of technological evolution (conservatism).

The goal of this exploration isn't to arrive at one single 'absolute' perspective on AI. Rather, it's to develop more sophisticated and reflective ways of thinking about our relationship with technology—to build a philosophical framework that acknowledges both opportunities and challenges while emphasizing human agency and collective wisdom in shaping our technological future.

#### **Practical Wisdom: Balanced Conversations Starting at Home**

I've made conscious efforts to cultivate this balanced perspective within our family. Rather than pitting my son's technological optimism against my wife's prudent skepticism, I acknowledge that both perspectives provide important insights.

For instance, when my daughter asked about using AI writing tools, instead of giving a simple "you can" or "absolutely not" answer, I started an exploratory conversation together. "Will this tool help you express your thoughts more clearly, or will it replace your thinking?" "In what situations is it useful, and in what situations could it be problematic?" Through such questions, children develop contextual judgment beyond simple binaries.

In many Korean homes, all educational choices are justified under the single goal of "admission to prestigious universities." Similarly, in the AI era, the fear of "falling behind in competition" can become the justification logic for all technology adoption. But what's truly needed are deeper questions: "What kind of learner, thinker, and human do we want to grow into?"

#### **Cultivating Contextual Wisdom**

By moving beyond simple narratives of technological utopia or dystopia, we can engage more wisely and effectively with the complex realities of AI evolution and its multilayered impact on how we learn, create, relate, and live.

This doesn't provide easy answers. Rather, it demands ongoing reflection, contextual judgment, and intellectual humility in the face of uncertainty. But precisely this intellectual maturity will be the most precious legacy we can leave our children.

Korean society is accustomed to rapid change and adaptation—the resilience that transformed a war-torn nation into a top-10 global economy in half a century, quick transition to an IT powerhouse, and cultural influence expansion through Hallyu. All these achievements came from a balanced sense of not fearing the new while not losing our identity and values.

In the AI era, what we need is exactly this sense of balance: exploring technology's possibilities with an open mind while not losing sight of fundamental questions about human dignity and meaningful life. This is the first step toward a mature technological civilization beyond binaries.
