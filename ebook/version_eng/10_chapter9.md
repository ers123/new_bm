# Chapter 9: The New Intelligence Humans and AI Create Together

## Collaborative Intelligence Models: The Creative Fusion of Human and AI

Last summer, our family visited a contemporary art exhibition featuring works created through human-AI collaboration. In one gallery, artists had used AI systems to generate seeds of initial concepts, then refined, transformed, and breathed life into them through traditional media. In another space, musicians presented symphonies born from the interweaving of AI-generated melodic geometries with human improvisational sensibility.

What moved me most deeply wasn't the technical sophistication—it was the emergent nature the works revealed. This was something entirely new: creativity arising at the intersection where different forms of intelligence meet, neither purely human nor purely artificial.

As we toured the exhibition, my teenage daughter, who's been building her own artistic world, was initially skeptical. "Isn't this just a kind of cheating that betrays the essence of creation? If AI handles the core of creative work, what does the artist's authenticity even mean?"

But as she engaged more deeply with the pieces, her perspective gradually shifted. She began noticing the nuances of each artist's unique, personal relationship with their AI tools. By the end of our visit, she was already imagining how this kind of collaborative creation might enrich her own artistic expression.

Yet on the drive home, I found myself thinking about the privilege embedded in this experience. Visiting an upscale gallery in the heart of Seoul isn't accessible to every family. The possibilities of collaborative intelligence can also be found in far more everyday, accessible contexts.

## Collaborative Intelligence in Daily Life: Concrete Korean Examples

### Neighborhood Hagwons and AI Tutors Combined

A friend of mine who teaches middle school math in Gangnam recently started an interesting experiment. He integrated an AI math tutoring app into his classes, but ensured students didn't become completely dependent on it. Instead, they were encouraged to critically review the solutions AI presented, suggest better explanations, and develop their own solution paths.

The results were remarkable. Yes, grades improved, but more importantly, students began asking deeper questions about mathematical concepts. Rather than blindly accepting AI-provided answers, they started asking metacognitive questions like "Why is this method more efficient?" and "What other approaches exist?"

### Smart Inventory Management at a Small Restaurant

The owner of a small gimbap shop near my house is in his sixties, but recently adopted an AI-based inventory management system. Initially he was afraid of the technology, but with help from a young employee, he began to understand it.

What's interesting is that he doesn't blindly follow AI predictions. He combines the intuition accumulated over 30 years of experience—weather patterns, nearby construction schedules, school exam calendars—with AI's data analysis. "This machine reads numbers well, but it can't read regular customers' faces," he says with a laugh. As a result, food waste decreased by 40%, while customer satisfaction actually improved.

### Reading Recommendation Programs at Public Libraries

A public library in Seoul's Mapo district runs a program combining an AI reading recommendation system with librarians' expertise. AI analyzes borrowing records and reading patterns to provide basic recommendations, but librarians engage in brief conversations with individual readers to understand their current interests, emotional state, and reading purpose.

One librarian explained: "AI tells me 'people who read this book also read this one,' but I find 'the book this person needs at this moment.'" This collaborative approach has been especially popular with teenage readers. AI's broad data analysis meets the librarian's empathetic understanding to create more meaningful reading experiences.

## Understanding Complementary Intelligence: Two Worlds Meeting

To truly grasp the transformative potential of collaborative intelligence, we need to explore deeply the fundamentally different cognitive strengths and limitations that humans and AI each possess.

### The Unique Strengths of Human Intelligence: Evolution's Gift

Human intelligence was born from an evolutionary journey spanning millions of years—one demanding social cooperation, complex interaction with the physical world, and creative adaptation to constantly changing environmental challenges.

**The Magic of Contextual Understanding**: Humans intuitively decode the multilayered context of situations, including unspoken social norms, subtle emotional nuances, and the complex cultural reference systems that construct meaning.

For instance, in Korean workplace culture, the phrase "gwaenchansseumnida" (it's okay) can mean the complete opposite depending on context. When a boss suggests additional work, "it's okay" often actually means "this is burdensome but I find it hard to refuse." AI can analyze the surface meaning of words, but it can't grasp these cultural subtleties and power dynamics.

**The Wisdom of Common Sense Reasoning**: We have a deep, intuitive understanding of how the physical and social worlds work.

When my son encounters a new math problem, he naturally draws on physical intuition developed through years of embodied experience. He already understands in his body that doubling a circle's radius will increase its area by more than double—before ever memorizing the formula.

**The Subtlety of Ethical Judgment**: Humans can make moral judgments that consider multiple ethical frameworks, situational factors, and delicate balances between competing values.

Consider the recent controversy in Korea over banning the Tada ride-sharing service. This wasn't simply a matter of legal interpretation—it was a complex ethical issue requiring balance among competing values: freedom of innovation, livelihood rights of existing industry workers, and consumer choice. Such judgments require human wisdom beyond AI's data analysis.

**The Art of Creative Recombination**: We demonstrate exceptional ability to move across different domains of knowledge, innovatively connecting ideas, discovering unexpected metaphors, and creatively reinterpreting existing concepts in new contexts.

Director Bong Joon-ho's *Parasite* is an excellent example of creative recombination—combining the universal theme of class conflict with specific contexts of Korean society (semi-basement apartments, ram-don, scholar's rocks) to elicit worldwide empathy.

### The Unique Strengths of Artificial Intelligence: The Art of Computation

Artificial intelligence displays remarkable capabilities in cognitive domains fundamentally different from humans.

**Pattern Recognition in Vast Datasets**: AI systems can identify subtle patterns across billions of data points that would be imperceptible to human perception.

Naver Papago's high accuracy in Korean-English translation comes from learning hundreds of millions of translation examples and capturing subtle language patterns—millions of times more examples than a human translator could encounter in a lifetime.

**The Virtue of Consistent Performance**: AI doesn't experience performance fluctuations due to fatigue, emotional ups and downs, or changes in concentration.

AI-based inventory management systems used in Korea's 24-hour unmanned convenience stores operate with exactly the same accuracy at 3 AM as at 3 PM—times when human employees might make fatigue-related errors.

**The Speed of Rapid Information Processing**: AI can analyze and synthesize vast amounts of information at speeds far exceeding human cognitive limits.

In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Korea's CDC could rapidly identify and publicly disclose confirmed patients' movement routes thanks to AI-based analysis systems. Analyzing tens of thousands of card transaction records, CCTV footage, and telecommunications data within hours would have been impossible with humans alone.

## The Limitations of Both Forms of Intelligence: Opportunities for Mutual Complement

Both humans and AI have their own inherent limitations, and these limitations actually create natural opportunities for collaboration.

**Human Intelligence Limitations**:
- Cognitive biases that systematically distort judgment
- Limited working memory and easily distracted attention
- Inconsistent performance affected by fatigue, emotional state, physical condition
- Limited capacity to process large amounts of information simultaneously

**Current AI Limitations**:
- Absence of common sense understanding and contextual awareness
- Difficulty transferring knowledge across different domains
- Limited causal reasoning abilities
- Lack of intrinsic goals or value systems to guide judgment

## Practicing Collaborative Intelligence: Applications in Educational Settings

### A Seoul High School Case

An English teacher at a high school in Gangnam uses AI writing tools in a unique way. Students first draft essays with their own thinking, then use AI tools to receive improvement suggestions. But it doesn't end there.

Students submit three versions—their initial draft, AI's suggestions, and a final version combining both—and must explain what choices they made at each stage. Metacognitive reflections like "AI suggested this more sophisticated expression, but it diverged from my original intent so I didn't adopt it" become an important part of the evaluation.

Through this process, students came to see AI not as a cheating tool but as a collaborative partner, and reflected more deeply on their own writing process.

### Elementary Math Class in Busan

At an elementary school in Busan, the AI math tutor and teacher divide roles. AI analyzes each student's error patterns to provide customized practice problems. But the teacher uses this data as a basis for one-on-one conversations with students.

"You do well with multiplication, so why do you only struggle with fraction multiplication?" The teacher asks empathetic questions AI can't provide. Sometimes she discovers the cause isn't lack of mathematical understanding but emotional factors like test anxiety, family problems, or lack of confidence.

One student said: "The AI teacher tells me I got it wrong, but the real teacher tells me why I got it wrong and how I can be okay."

## The Future of Collaborative Intelligence: Practicing at Home

Collaborative intelligence doesn't require grand technology or expensive tools. It can be implemented in everyday learning and problem-solving processes.

### Practicing Collaborative Intelligence at the Dinner Table

Our family has "problem-solving nights" every weekend. We choose an everyday problem—travel planning, budget management, home organization—and first use AI tools (ChatGPT, Google Lens, etc.) to gather information. But the final decision comes through family discussion.

For example, when planning summer vacation:
1. Input budget and preferences into AI to receive destination recommendations
2. Each family member reviews AI recommendations and discusses "why would/wouldn't this place suit our family"
3. Consider elements AI missed—grandma's mobility difficulties, children's specific allergies, places with family memories
4. Make the final decision by combining AI's data with the family's context

Through this process, children naturally learn to use AI as a useful tool while understanding that final judgment requires human contextual understanding and value judgments.

## New Possibilities That Collaborative Intelligence Creates

The collaborative intelligence framework represents a fundamental philosophical shift in the dominant narrative surrounding AI. The existing narrative often defined the relationship between humans and AI as competition. But the truly revolutionary and promising possibilities are born from genuine creative collaboration, not opposition.

I've directly experienced the beautiful dynamics of this complementary relationship in my own research work. When analyzing complex datasets, I rely on AI tools to identify patterns and correlations across thousands of variables—work that's simply physically impossible for my human brain.

But in the next stage, I apply rich contextual knowledge, causal reasoning, and ethical judgment to meaningfully interpret these patterns and determine appropriate courses of action. Either form of intelligence alone would be insufficient. True value emerges from their creative, harmonious cooperation.

Our goal isn't to prophesy exactly what this collaborative future will look like. Rather, it's to develop conceptual tools that will help us navigate this transformation wisely and intentionally—to consciously choose and design new forms of relationship where humans and AI resonate in ways that expand rather than diminish human ontological flourishing.

Korean society has a culture that understands well the power of "together." Traditional collaborative cultures like poomasi (labor exchange), durae (communal farming groups), and gye (rotating credit associations) show the wisdom of overcoming individual limitations through community strength. Collaborative intelligence in the AI era can be understood in the same context. Humans and AI—acknowledging each other's strengths, complementing weaknesses, and creating better results together. Isn't this the 21st century version of poomasi?
