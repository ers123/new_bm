# Chapter 11: The Great Software Revolution

## The Changing Landscape of AI Development: A New Paradigm of Creation and Learning

The day my eldest daughter came home from her first hackathon competition as an eighth grader, something was off. Unlike the morning when she left full of excitement and confidence, her eyes when she returned that evening were a mix of confusion and frustration.

"Dad..." She hesitated for a long time before speaking. "Our team worked really hard. For four hours, we wrote every single line of code ourselves. Every button, every screen—we built everything from scratch. Just like our teacher taught us."

But when she saw other teams' presentations, some teams had used pre-built components and gotten help from AI tools to create more polished apps in just two hours.

"It didn't feel fair."

Her words contained something beyond simple competitive disappointment. It was a fundamental question about whether what she'd worked so hard to learn actually meant anything. Doubt about whether all those late nights practicing coding, struggling to understand algorithms—whether that time had been spent in the right direction.

I put my arm around her shoulders and asked, "So how did you feel? What did it make you think?"

"At first I was angry. But later... I was confused. Is everything I've been learning wrong? Teachers said 'you need to learn the fundamentals to build real skills,' but is that actually true?"

Right then, I realized. What my daughter had encountered wasn't simply a problem of technical competition, but a paradigm shift in education and learning that our entire era faces.

That night, we talked for a long time. And a few days later, I had the chance to share this story with a senior Korean developer.

## A Developer's Confession: "My Son Makes Things Faster Than I Do"

"Honestly, at first it was hard to accept."

Senior colleague Kim, who's worked as a developer in Seoul's Pangyo for over twenty years, spoke candidly. We were meeting for coffee during my visit to Korea, chatting about this and that.

"My son's in high school and recently started learning to code. So I offered to help him. But when I watched him work... it was shocking."

Senior Kim recalled what he'd studied all night in his twenties—C language pointers, memory management, complex algorithms. Back then, he believed you couldn't become a good developer without "properly" understanding those things.

"But my son doesn't know any of that. Instead, what does he do? He finds pre-built components on GitHub, asks AI tools 'connect this like this'... and in thirty minutes he whips up something better than what took me three days to make back then."

Senior Kim paused. Complex emotions crossed his face.

"At first I thought, 'that's not real skill.' But honestly... at work these days, we work that way too. Use already-verified libraries, leverage AI tools. Because it's faster and more efficient. But one part of my mind keeps thinking: 'Then what was all that struggle I went through to learn?'"

I nodded. In Senior Kim's story, I saw exactly the confusion my daughter had felt.

"But you know," Senior Kim continued, "something interesting happened recently. A bug appeared in my son's app, and he couldn't solve it. AI couldn't answer either. So I looked, and it was a problem from lack of basic data structure understanding. I fixed it in ten minutes."

"That's when I realized. Ah, what I learned wasn't useless. It's just that the 'way we use it' has changed."

He paused in thought before continuing.

"These days I tell junior developers this: 'Let tools give you what tools can give, but you make the judgments.' AI can generate code, but people need to know why that code works that way, what cases might cause problems."

"And one more thing. My son's generation can start much faster than I did. It took us years building from fundamentals, but kids can immediately make something with tools' help. But to become a truly deep developer, at some point they need to fill in those fundamentals. The sequence has just reversed."

Listening to Senior Kim's story, I gained an important insight. What we're witnessing isn't the "death of fundamentals" but a "reordering of when and how fundamentals are learned."

## From Writing to Assembly: But Where Does the Heart Lie?

I can understand the technical changes. But what I really struggled with was something else.

The experience of immersion my daughter must have felt during those four hours writing code. The process of encountering errors, pondering, solving them, and growing through it all. That can't be measured solely by the yardstick of "efficiency."

I also talked with another Korean developer friend, Manager Park in his late twenties. He's from a generation that actively leverages AI tools.

"Senior, I have lots of concerns too," Manager Park said honestly. "Making things quickly with AI help is nice, but sometimes I think: 'Did I really make this?'"

"It's especially hard when junior developers ask me 'how does this work?' If there's AI-generated code that I don't fully understand... it's embarrassing."

In his confession, I discovered an important truth. Even as tools advance, human self-esteem and sense of achievement still come from "understanding" and "creation."

Manager Park continued: "So these days I do it this way. Even when asking AI to generate something, I first think through how I'd implement it in my head. Then looking at AI's result, I learn 'oh, this approach exists too.' If I just copy-paste, my skills don't grow later."

Through these conversations, I realized. What we really need to consider isn't "whether to use AI tools" but "how to use them."

## Traditional Craftsmanship: Not Disappearing, But Evolving

I think back to when I first learned development. Late 1990s, when I was studying computer science in Korea.

We were taught this way: "You must understand every line. If you just take someone else's code, your skills won't improve."

So we implemented sorting algorithms ourselves. Built data structures from scratch. Wrestled with pointer errors through the night.

The process was painful, but simultaneously felt like some sacred ritual. Like a blacksmith hammering iron into a sword, we hammered code into programs.

But looking back now, what was the essence of that "craftsmanship"?

It wasn't typing every line of code by hand. The real essence was "deeply understanding what you're making," "developing the ability to solve problems from their roots."

If so, that essence is still necessary in the AI era. Only the way we implement it will differ.

Old blacksmiths smelted iron themselves. Modern craftsmen use factory-made steel. But the difference between true craftsmen and others isn't whether they make materials themselves, but whether they understand materials and what they create with them.

## The Story I Told My Daughter: "Your Four Hours Weren't Wasted"

That night, I sat with my daughter again.

"Emma, I understand the frustration you felt at the hackathon. You sweated for four hours to make something other teams whipped up in two."

My daughter nodded.

"But listen, let me ask you something. What did you learn during those four hours?"

She thought briefly before answering. "Um... at first the button wouldn't click. So I looked up event handlers and learned how to connect them. And when saving data, it kept disappearing at first, but then I discovered something called local storage."

"Right. In that process, you actually encountered problems and solved them yourself. That's an experience no AI tool can replace."

"But what about the other team?"

"The other team made it quickly. But if problems arise in that app? If they don't know why the components they used work that way, it'll be hard to solve. You've already solved those kinds of problems yourself."

My daughter's expression brightened a bit.

"And Emma, I think next time you can do both. Use the foundational knowledge you learned, and also leverage tools. Then you can make something faster and better. Much more powerfully than someone who only uses tools without fundamentals."

My daughter asked, "But what if AI advances more? If it really does everything, will there still be work for people then?"

This was the question I needed to answer most carefully.

"Emma, there's one thing I'm certain of. No matter how much AI advances, 'deciding what to make' will be people's job. AI is just a tool. No matter how good a hammer is, the craftsman decides what to make with it."

"And more importantly, judging whether what AI made is truly 'good' or 'right' is also people's role. For example, if AI made an app but made it hard for disabled people to use? Noticing and fixing that is people's work."

My daughter was listening seriously.

"Those fundamentals you learned this time, the experience of solving problems, and the habit of pondering 'why'—that's what will make you a true creator in the AI era, not just a tool user."

That night before bed, my daughter told me: "Dad, at the next hackathon I want to do it right. Based on what I learned, while also using tools."

I hugged her tight.

## The Art of Assembly: Birth of New Creativity

A few months later, my daughter entered another hackathon.

This time was different. She first spent an hour with teammates defining "the problem we really want to solve." They chose an actual inconvenience from school—difficulty coordinating club activity schedules—as their topic.

Next, my daughter designed the overall system. What functions were needed, how data should flow. Only then did they move to implementation.

This time they used an already-verified calendar component. They got help from AI tools. But every choice had a reason. They constantly reviewed "why we're using this library," "whether AI's suggested code fits our purpose."

The results were remarkable. They created a much more polished app than before and received feedback from judges: "Problem definition is clear, solution is practical."

On the way home, my daughter said, "Dad, I get it now. Making it fast isn't what's important—the 'why' and 'what' are important. Tools just help with that."

I patted my daughter's shoulder. "Right. Now you're a real developer."

## A Story from a Korean Startup CEO

A startup CEO I met in Seoul told me a striking story.

"Two new employees joined our company. One's from a coding bootcamp, one's from a computer science program."

"The bootcamp grad is really fast. Knows all the latest frameworks, proficient with AI tools. First month or two, definitely stood out."

"But around three months in, differences started showing. When complex problems arose, the CS grad would break down problems and find root causes, while the bootcamp grad would stop at Googling and asking AI."

"So these days when hiring, we look at it this way. Tool utilization matters, but can they ponder 'why'? Can they think for themselves when facing new problems?"

His story gave me important insight. Real capability in the AI era isn't "whether you use tools" but "whether you know when, how, and why to use tools."

## The True Meaning of the Great Software Revolution

As I conclude this chapter, I've realized.

The "great software revolution" we're witnessing isn't just a revolution of technology. It's a revolution in how we understand "creation."

In the past, "making everything yourself from start to finish" was creation. But now, "the entire process of defining problems, designing solutions, selecting the best tools to implement, and evaluating results" is creation.

Pianists don't make pianos themselves. But they create beautiful music with them. Painters don't manufacture paints themselves. But they paint moving pictures with them.

Likewise, future developers may not write all code from scratch. But they're still creators. Creators who discover problems, envision solutions, wisely leverage tools to make value that didn't exist in the world.

And what's most important in that creative process still doesn't change.

The effort to understand deeply.
The curiosity to constantly ask "why."
The persistence not to give up before problems.
And above all, responsibility and pride in what you make.

My daughter's four hours of struggle at that first hackathon were never wasted. What she learned during that time wasn't simple coding skills, but the fundamental qualities for becoming a true creator.

And because she has those qualities, she can now become someone who doesn't simply use AI tools, but makes them tools of creation.

This is the true meaning of the great software revolution.

Tools change. Technology evolves. But the essence of humans creating—the ability to think, judge, and give meaning—is eternal.

And cultivating precisely that eternal ability is the most precious gift we can give our children.

**[Practice Activities with Children]**

**"Creator's Question Notebook"**

When your child makes something (whether coding, Lego, or drawing), share these questions together:

1. **Before making**: "Why do you want to make this? What problem do you want to solve?"
2. **While making**: "What part is hard right now? Should we get help, or try it yourself?"
3. **After completion**: "What was the hardest part? What did you learn there?"
4. **When using tools**: "Why do you need this tool? Could you do it without it?"

These questions help children think about "how and why they made it" rather than just "what they made." That's the starting point of being a true creator in the AI era.
