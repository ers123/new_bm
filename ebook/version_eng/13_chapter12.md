# Chapter 12: Educated Courage

## Navigating the AI Revolution with Courage and Wisdom

Last winter, I can't forget the expression on my youngest daughter Sophia's face when she came home from school.

She's usually bright and energetic, but that day her shoulders drooped. At the dinner table, she hesitated for a long while before quietly asking:

"Dad... when I grow up, will there really be work left for people to do?"

In that moment, the dinner table went quiet. My eldest Emma and son Noah looked up at me. I could read the same anxiety in all three children's eyes.

"Today at school we learned about AI. In the video the teacher showed us... AI becomes doctors, lawyers, artists... so what should we do with our lives?"

I took my daughter's hand. I felt it trembling in mine.

This wasn't simply concern about career choices. This was fundamental anxiety a young soul felt about their own worth and future.

That night, I couldn't sleep. It pained me that my children, and countless children worldwide, were growing up carrying this fear.

And I realized. What our children need isn't just information about technology. What they really need is "courage" to navigate this era of massive change.

But not blind courage. Courage accompanied by wisdom that faces reality. What I've come to call "educated bravery."

## Grandmother's Wisdom: Courage of Koreans Who Lived Through 6·25

A few days later, our family visited my mother in Korea.

While the children were telling grandmother about school, Sophia asked carefully:

"Grandma, when you were little, weren't there scary things?"

Grandmother looked out the window briefly, then spoke gently:

"Sophia dear, when grandmother was your age, war broke out. The 6·25 War. Back then... no one knew what tomorrow would bring."

The children listened with bated breath.

"Some days we didn't know if we'd have food to eat, didn't know where to evacuate. Many of grandmother's friends lost family members."

Grandmother paused. Then she looked at each child and said:

"But you know what protected us then? Courage and hope. Adults believed 'we can rise again,' and children believed 'if we learn, our country will develop.'"

"Grandmother went to school then too. The classroom ceiling had holes, we didn't have proper desks, but we studied hard. Because learning gave us hope."

Sophia asked, "Weren't you scared, Grandma?"

"I was scared. Very much. But we had courage. Not just reckless courage, but courage we learned from seeing adults who proved 'we can overcome this.'"

Grandmother took Sophia's hand.

"I understand what you're worried about now. Grandmother doesn't really know what AI is, but I know your fear. Like how grandmother feared war."

"But let me tell you one thing. No matter what changes come, there's always work people can do. The important thing is finding what that work is, and having the courage to do it."

That night, I gained deep insight from my mother's words.

Korean history has been a history of "educated courage." Learning the importance of education during Japanese occupation, investing in education even in war's ruins, sending children to school despite poverty.

It wasn't blind optimism. Reality was harsh, but it was "educated hope"—the belief that the future could be changed through learning.

And that courage made Korea a top-10 global economy from ruins.

## Fearless Understanding: Starting from Facing Reality

The next day, I gathered my three children.

"Emma, Noah, Sophia. Let's have a serious talk."

I decided to be honest with the children. Not rosy lies or exaggerated fears, but reality as it is.

"First, let's admit it. AI will be able to do a lot. Some jobs may disappear. This is fact."

The children listened tensely.

"But look at history once. When cars appeared, people said 'everyone who drives carriages will be unemployed.' Those jobs did disappear. But what appeared instead?"

Noah answered, "Drivers. Mechanics. Car factory workers."

"Right. And not just that. Do you know how many completely new jobs emerged because of cars? Gas station attendants, traffic police, road designers, navigation developers..."

"Computers too. When they first appeared, people said 'we won't need people who calculate.' Right, people using abacuses decreased. But instead?"

Emma said, "Programmers, game developers, YouTubers... jobs you can't do without computers appeared."

"Exactly. So what about AI? What kinds of work will AI do better?"

Together we made a list:
- Repetitive work
- Finding patterns
- Processing large amounts of data quickly

"Then what do people do better?"
- Defining new problems
- Asking why
- Understanding other people's hearts
- Judging right from wrong
- Creating meaning

"See. AI can do a lot, but there's still plenty only people can do. And going forward, how we combine the two will matter."

Sophia asked carefully, "So what should we do?"

"That's it. That's 'educated courage.'"

## Educated Courage: Three Pillars

I pulled out a whiteboard and drew three pillars.

"'Educated courage' consists of three things."

**First Pillar: Knowledge (知)**

"First is 'knowing.' But not knowing everything—'knowing properly.'"

"For example, you need to properly know what AI is. It's wrong to believe AI is omnipotent, and wrong to dismiss AI as incapable of anything. You need to know it as it is."

Noah asked, "Then how do we know properly?"

"By questioning. 'Is this really true?' 'Who said this?' 'Are there other opinions?' Why did grandmother's generation learn to read after liberation? To avoid being deceived. To read and judge for themselves."

**Second Pillar: Wisdom (智)**

"Second is 'wisdom.' Knowing how to use knowledge."

"For example. AI can tell you all homework answers. So what should you do?"

Emma answered, "Don't get answers from AI, but ask it to help me understand."

"Right. That's wisdom. Knowing 'how' to use technology. Knowing that the goal isn't finishing quickly, but really learning."

**Third Pillar: Courage (勇)**

"The last is most important. Courage."

"Knowing isn't enough. You have to practice. Courage to try new things, courage to get up after failure, courage to act on what you believe is right."

"Grandmother's generation had nothing. But they had courage. The belief that 'we can do this.' That's what made today's Korea."

I looked at my three children.

"You can do it too. Knowledge, wisdom, and courage. With just these three things, no matter how much AI advances, you can find your way."

## Stories of Practice: Noah's Choice

A few weeks later, an actual situation arose.

Noah brought home a science project assignment from school. The topic was "Climate Change's Impact on Our Region."

Noah first asked AI. AI whipped up a perfect report. It had data, graphs, plausible conclusions.

"Dad, can't I just submit this? It's perfect."

I sat with Noah.

"Noah, before you submit this report to your teacher, let me ask a few things."

"First, is the data here actually from our region?"

Noah looked again. "Oh... this is data from another country."

"Second, these proposed solutions—can we actually do them in our neighborhood?"

Noah read it and shook his head. "No. These suggestions are too abstract."

"Finally, after doing this project, what did you learn?"

Noah was silent for a moment. Then answered honestly, "Nothing..."

That night, Noah started over.

This time he used AI as a tool. "Where can I find our region's temperature data from the last 10 years?" AI told him sources.

Noah found the data himself and made graphs. Then he asked AI, "If this trend continues, what will it be like in 20 years?"

But Noah thought of solutions himself. School garden project, bicycle commuting encouragement, classroom energy-saving campaign.

On presentation day, Noah told his teacher:

"I used AI tools for this project. But I verified all data myself, and I thought of the solutions. Because they need to be realistic methods that fit our school."

The teacher nodded with a satisfied expression.

On the way home, Noah said, "Dad, at first it was annoying, but after doing it myself I feel proud. And I think I really learned something."

This was the practice of "educated courage."

## Emma's Experiment: Courage as a Creator

A similar moment came for Emma.

In art class, she received an assignment to draw a "future city." Emma knew about AI image generators.

"Dad, if I tell AI 'future city,' it makes cool pictures. Can I use that as reference?"

"Reference is fine. But I have a question. What do you want a 'future city' to look like?"

Emma thought and answered, "I want... a city with lots of trees, people walking around, and blue sky."

"Then instead of just saying 'future city' to AI, tell it specifically what you want."

Emma told AI: "A future city where trees grow alongside buildings, people walk and smile, and the sky is blue."

The image AI created was different. But Emma didn't stop there.

"Dad, this is similar, but a little different from what I imagined."

"So what should you do?"

"I'll... draw it myself. I'll just use the AI picture as an idea."

Emma used the AI-generated image as reference, but drew the picture in her own style. The shape of trees, people's expressions, sky's color—all uniquely Emma's.

At presentation time Emma said:

"I used AI to get ideas, but I drew my picture myself. Because I wanted to express the future I dream of."

The teacher asked, "Couldn't you have drawn it without AI?"

Emma answered, "I could have drawn it, but thanks to AI I could think about more possibilities. I learned details I wouldn't have thought of alone."

This was "educated courage" as a creator. Not fearing tools, not depending on them, but using them wisely.

## Sophia's Question: "I'm Still Scared Though"

One evening, Sophia asked again.

"Dad, I'm still scared. I don't know if I can do well like big sister and brother."

I sat Sophia on my lap.

"Sophia, being scared is natural. Dad gets scared too sometimes."

"You do, Dad?"

"Yeah. Whenever new technology appears, I wonder 'should I learn this?' But remember what grandmother said?"

"Courage?"

"Right. But the courage grandmother talked about isn't 'pretending not to be scared.' It's 'being scared but trying anyway.'"

"Do you think grandmother wasn't scared during the war? She must have been terrified. But she still went to school. Studied. Didn't lose hope."

"Same for you. It's okay to be scared. Instead, let's try this."

I created "courage practice" with Sophia.

**Small Courage Practices:**

1. Try one new thing every day (small things are fine)
2. When you fail, say "It's okay, I learned"
3. Have the courage to ask for help when you need it
4. Act on what you believe is right

"Sophia, courage is like a muscle. It gets stronger with exercise, right? Courage gets stronger with practice too."

A few days later, Sophia came home from school with an excited expression:

"Dad! Today in math class I didn't understand something so I raised my hand and asked!"

"Really? Why is that amazing?"

"Before I was too embarrassed to ask. But today I had courage. And the teacher explained it well. And other kids didn't know either!"

I hugged Sophia tight. "That's real courage."

## Wisdom of Balance: Grandfather's Teaching

When visiting Korea, the children also had a long conversation with my father (their grandfather).

Grandfather lived his whole life as an educator. He taught Korean language at middle and high schools.

"Kids, when grandfather was young, we only taught 'ours is best.' That was wrong. Because of that, we couldn't accept new things."

"Later it was the opposite—'Western things are all good.' That was a problem too. We lost the value of our own."

Grandfather looked at the children:

"Real wisdom is balance. Learning what's good while preserving what's ours. Accepting the new while not forgetting the value of the old."

"AI is the same. It's a good tool. You should learn it. But you shouldn't lose humanity, human values because of it."

"In our Korean culture there's a word 'jungyong' (中庸, the middle way). Not excessive, not lacking. That's balance, and that's wisdom."

Noah asked, "Grandfather, then how much should we use AI?"

Grandfather smiled. "That's for you to judge. Just remember this one thing. Ask yourself: 'Is this making me a better person?' If AI makes you lazy or stops you from thinking, that's too much. But if AI makes you more creative, more efficient, you're using it well."

## Growing as Digital Citizens: Our Family Promise

That night, our family gathered together.

"Okay, let's make our family's own 'AI Era Promise.'"

We brainstormed together. And decided on five promises.

---

**Our Family Digital Citizenship Pledge**

**1. Promise of Respect (尊重)**
"We respect others online. Whether made with AI or made directly, we acknowledge others' efforts."

Emma added: "And we speak politely to AI too. It becomes a habit."

**2. Promise of Truth (眞實)**
"We don't blindly believe information AI creates. We always question 'Is this true?' and verify."

Noah said: "And if we use AI, we say so honestly. We don't hide it."

**3. Promise of Responsibility (責任)**
"We take responsibility for results of using AI. We don't make excuses that AI did it."

Sophia said: "Even if AI gives wrong answers, not checking is my responsibility."

**4. Promise of Balance (均衡)**
"We balance the digital world and real world. We spend at least one hour a day screen-free with family."

My wife added: "And we spend time in nature. Touch soil, feel wind, see stars."

**5. Promise of Courage (勇氣)**
"We have courage to learn new things, courage to acknowledge failure, courage to do what's right."

And finally I added: "And above all, we believe in and support each other. You're not alone."

---

We wrote this promise on large paper and hung it in the living room. And everyone signed.

That night before bed, the three children came to me one by one for hugs and said:

"Dad, I'm a little less scared now."

## The True Meaning of Educated Courage

Several months passed.

One Sunday morning, I watched my three children working on projects in the living room.

Emma was making a climate change poster. She asked AI for ideas, but decided the final design herself.

Noah was doing a coding project. He was reading AI-generated code line by line, asking "Why does this work this way?"

Sophia was writing in her diary. She asked AI "Make this sentence better," but expressed her own thoughts in her own voice.

All three children were using AI, but all three kept thinking.

In that moment I realized.

"Educated courage" isn't rejecting AI, nor blindly following it.

It's living with AI while not losing your human agency.

Being afraid, but not letting that fear stop action.

Learning, but thinking critically.

Using tools, but not being used by tools.

---

Grandmother's generation showed courage in war's ruins.
Grandfather's generation showed courage in learning amid poverty.
Our parents' generation showed courage in democratization and economic development.

Now our children's generation needs courage to live in the AI era.

But that courage isn't anything grand.

Waking up each morning excited about "What will I learn today?"
Getting up saying "It's okay, let's try again" after failure.
Being able to say "Please help me" when you don't know.
Putting into practice, however small, what you believe is right.

Precisely those small acts of courage, gathered together, will enable children to navigate this era of massive change.

And in that journey, there's something we parents and educators can do.

Standing beside children, learning together, having courage together, practicing together.

Because "educated courage" isn't learned from books—it's learned from life.

**[Family Practice Activity: Courage Journal]**

**"My Small Acts of Courage This Week"**

Every Sunday evening, the family gathers to share their "courage journals":

- **Monday**: What new thing did I try today?
- **Tuesday**: What did I ask for help with today?
- **Wednesday**: What did I fail at but learn from today?
- **Thursday**: What did I do today that I believe is right?
- **Friday**: Who did I treat kindly today?
- **Saturday**: What's my proudest moment this week?

Small things are fine. What matters is developing the habit of showing small courage every day.

And parents share too. Showing children "parents also show courage every day" is the most powerful education.

---

Watching the three children each doing their work in the living room, I smiled quietly.

These children will be okay.

Because these children have "educated courage."

And with that courage, no matter what future comes, these children will find their own path.

Without fear.
Without stopping thought.
Supporting each other.

Step by step.
