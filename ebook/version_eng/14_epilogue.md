# Epilogue: A Letter to My Children

---

Dear Emma, Noah, and Sophia,

As I write this letter, the night is deep and the world is quiet. You're all asleep by now, but Dad sits at his desk, revisiting memories from the past few years.

I started writing this book because of you. Precisely because of the look in all three of your eyes one evening at the dinner table.

Emma, you came back from the hackathon and asked, "Is what I learned useless?"
Noah, you asked, "If AI does everything, what do we do?"
Sophia, you asked, "When I grow up, will there be work left for people?"

In those questions, I saw it. Anxiety and confusion, and simultaneously desperate hope. You were afraid, yet still dreaming of the future.

That night, I decided. I wanted to give you answers. Even if not perfect ones, at least a compass to help us find the way together.

That's how this book began.

But while writing, I realized. The one who really learned wasn't you—it was me.

Watching you wrestle with AI, fail, and rise again, I learned.
Watching you each accept technology differently and find your own paths, I learned.

So this final chapter isn't "a letter where Dad teaches."
This is "a letter where Dad shares what he learned from you."

## To Emma: About Learning

Dear firstborn daughter, Emma,

It feels like yesterday I first held you, and somehow you've already grown taller than Dad.

Emma, you always asked "why?" From age five until now, the word that's come from your mouth most is "why."

"Why is the sky blue?"
"Why do people think differently?"
"Why is this method better?"

When you were little, honestly Dad got tired sometimes. Coming home after working all day and getting your question barrage... (laughs)

But looking back now, that "why" was your greatest talent.

Remember? What you said when you came back from the middle school hackathon.

"The other team used AI and made it quickly, but we made it from scratch. It's not fair."

I can't forget the conversation we had that night. Because that day, I learned from you what real learning is.

You were frustrated at first. But during those four hours writing code yourself, you learned. Why the button didn't work, why the data disappeared, and how to solve it.

The other team may have made results quickly, but you gained real understanding in that process.

And at the next hackathon, you proved it. How powerful someone is who has fundamentals and knows how to use tools too.

Emma, there's something I want to tell you.

The world will demand you become "the fastest learner." Faster than others, more, more efficiently.

But real learning isn't about speed.

Real learning is about depth.

Truly understanding what you learned.
Connecting it to your life.
Seeing the world differently through it.

AI can give information. Quickly, abundantly, accurately.
But AI can't see the world through your eyes.
AI can't feel meaning with your heart.

When you learn history, you don't simply memorize dates and events—you ask "Why did those people make those choices?"

When you learn science, you don't memorize formulas—you connect "How does this work in my daily life?"

That's it, Emma. That's your learning. That makes you not a simple information repository, but someone who creates meaning.

Remember what you said recently?

"Dad, AI wrote me a perfect essay. But when I read it, it wasn't my voice. So I rewrote it."

In that moment, I was so proud.

Because you knew. That more important than a perfect essay is finding your voice.

Emma, in your learning ahead, remember just this.

Deep rather than fast.
Meaningful rather than abundant.
Your questions rather than others' answers.

As long as you ask "why?", you're really learning.

And that "why" is the beginning of your learning that no AI can replace—yours alone.

I believe. That you'll live as someone who learns for life.
Not simply accumulating knowledge, but as someone who understands the world and creates meaning.

That's real learning in the AI era.

I love you, Emma.
Your endless curiosity and deep thinking will make the world brighter.

## To Noah: About Creation

Dear son, Noah,

You received your first Legos at age five. From that day on, our living room became your creative space.

At first you followed instructions. Fire trucks, spaceships, castles. You were so excited completing each one.

But one day, you closed the instructions. And started making what was in your head.

"This is half ship, half plane. It can go in water and sky."

I asked laughing, "Does that actually exist?"

You answered seriously, "No. That's why I'm making it."

That's when I knew. You're a creator.

Noah, as you grew, you made many things.

You built intricate cities in Minecraft,
Made games in Scratch,
Recently you're even making short films with friends.

But when AI image generators appeared, you were confused.

"Dad, AI makes cooler things than I imagined. Then do I need to make things myself?"

Remember? The experiment we did that night.

I asked, "Tell AI what spaceship you want."

You said, "A future spaceship."

AI made a cool image. Sleek, shining, perfect.

But I asked again, "Is this what you imagined?"

You shook your head. "It's similar... but what I thought of is rounder, has more windows, and a garden in back."

"Then tell AI more specifically."

You tried again. More detailed, more specific.

The result got closer. But it wasn't completely the same.

That's when you realized.

"Dad, AI makes what I say. But to fully express what's in my head, it's better if I make it myself."

That's it, Noah.

Creation isn't just the end product.
Creation is the process of moving your imagination to reality.
In that process, your vision becomes clearer, your abilities grow.

Remember the short film you made recently?

You asked AI for scene ideas. AI made many good suggestions.

But you made the final story.
Because you knew. This story was about "friendship." That you wanted to capture real emotions you experienced with friends.

AI can make "a story about friendship."
But only Noah can make "Noah's friendship story."

Noah, you'll encounter more AI tools ahead.

Image generation, music composition, video editing... AI will be able to do more and more.

You might be confused then. "So what's my job?"

Let me answer you.

Your job is to have your vision.

AI is a tool. An excellent tool. Like a good brush, a good camera.

Renaissance painters also used brushes someone made. They became great artists not because of brushes. Because of their vision, their way of seeing the world.

Same thing. Using AI tools is fine. No, you should use them actively.

But what matters is having tools implement your vision. Not you following the tool's vision.

What you said recently really impressed me.

"Dad, AI gives me inspiration. But I make the final choices. Because this is my work."

That's it.

Inspiration can come from anywhere. From other works, from nature, from friends, from AI.

But creation is yours.
What came from your heart.
What you shaped with your hands.
What contains your soul.

Noah, just one more thing.

There's no right answer in creation. Someone might say your work is "not perfect."

But remember. More important than perfection is authenticity.

What you made with sincerity, what contains your story.
Even if it's not technically perfect, it has value—unique in the world.

Because it's Noah's work.

The world will overflow with perfect AI-generated products.
But what's really needed is Noah's voice.
Stories only you can tell.

Keep creating, Noah.
Keep imagining, trying, failing, and creating again.

In that process, you'll discover.
That creation is a beautiful privilege unique to humans
that no amount of AI advancement can ever replace.

I love you, Noah.
Your creativity will add new light to the world.

## To Sophia: About Work

Dear youngest daughter, Sophia,

You're the baby of our family, but sometimes the most practical.

When big sister and brother talk about their dreams, you listen quietly then ask:

"So how do we actually do that?"
"Is that really possible?"
"Then what specifically should we do?"

At first I thought you were a "realist." I even worried you might lack dreams.

But now I know. You're not a realist—you're a "practitioner."

You dream dreams, but you're someone who finds ways to make those dreams reality.

Sophia, I can't forget the question you asked at the dinner table last winter.

"Dad, when I grow up, will there be work left for people?"

That question didn't contain only fear.
It also held yearning. "I want to be a useful person too."

Sophia, let me tell you clearly.

You will be a useful person.
No, you already are a useful person.

Because "usefulness" isn't measured by how much work AI can do.

Real usefulness is elsewhere.

Remember? Last year when you did the environmental project at school.

You wanted to do a "reduce plastic" campaign. But you felt stuck.

"How can I get people to actually do it?"

You asked AI. AI gave many good ideas.

Make posters, SNS campaigns, petition drives...

But you didn't do any of those as-is.

Instead you went to the cafeteria. You talked with the lunch ladies.

"Ma'am, where does the school use the most disposables?"
"How can we reduce them?"
"Is there anything I can help with?"

And you discovered. Students left behind tons of plastic bags from fruit.

So you created a simple solution.

A "bring your own container for fruit" corner.
Students bring lunch boxes or handkerchiefs to carry fruit.

Only a few did it at first. But you didn't give up—you stood at that corner every day explaining to students.

A month later, half the students participated.

The school reduced disposable plastic bag use by 70%.

That day you told me:

"Dad, AI gave good ideas. But actually implementing it was my job. Meeting people, persuading them, standing there every day. AI can't do that."

That's it, Sophia.

AI can give ideas.
It can analyze data.
It can even make plans.

But implementation? That's people's work.

Especially work done while building relationships with others.

Sophia, I don't know what work you'll end up doing.

You might become a doctor, a teacher, a businessperson.
Or have a job that doesn't even exist yet.

But one thing is certain.

For your work to have value, it must be for people.

AI can increase efficiency.
Help you work faster, more accurately.

But "why" that work matters,
Who it's for,
How to help more people.

Only people can judge that.

Like you, going to the cafeteria to talk with the lunch lady,
Communicating daily with students,
Creating small changes.

That's precisely the work AI can never replace.

Sophia, there's something I want to ask of you.

Whatever work you choose ahead, ask these questions:

"Who does this work help?"
"How does this work make the world a better place?"
"Why am I doing this work?"

AI can answer "how."
But you must answer "why."

And if you work with that "why" in your heart,
Whatever that work is, you'll be a useful person.

No, you already are a useful person.

Because you know.
That what really matters isn't technology but people.
That real change comes not from ideas but from practice.

One more thing.

Work can sometimes feel hard, exhausting, like it's lost meaning.

When that happens, remember.

The faces of people you helped.
The change your small practice made.
The good influence you left on the world.

That's your work's meaning.

I love you, Sophia.
Your practicing courage will change the world.

## To All Three Children: About Life

Dear Emma, Noah, and Sophia,

Beyond learning, creation, work... all of these,
What Dad really wants to talk about is "life."

How to live in the AI era.

This isn't a technology question. It's a life question.

While you were born and growing up, I saw many changes.

Smartphones appeared,
Social media emerged,
Now AI has entered deep into our lives.

In that process, I made many mistakes.

I spent too much time in front of screens,
Sometimes missed time with family,
Put off things that really mattered.

So I hope you'll live different lives.

Using technology but not being controlled by it.
Pursuing efficiency but not losing meaning.
Moving quickly but having depth.

What does that mean?

---

**First, protect your agency.**

Don't live according to what AI recommends.
Don't see the world only as algorithms show you.

Ask what you really want.
Find what you're really interested in.
Think about what values you hold dear.

AI gives convenience.
But convenience isn't always right.

Sometimes the inconvenient path might be your path.
Sometimes the slow method might be more meaningful.

Emma, when you read books, even though AI summaries exist, you read slowly yourself.
Why? Because that's your learning.

Noah, when you make games, even though templates exist, you want to make from scratch.
Why? Because that's your creation.

Sophia, you'd rather meet friends in person than message them.
Why? Because that's real relationship.

Those choices. That's precisely agency.

---

**Second, cherish relationships.**

AI can do many things.
But AI can't really love you.
AI can't really hurt with your sadness.
AI can't really rejoice with your joy.

Only people can.

Family, friends, teachers, neighbors...
These relationships are what truly enrich your lives.

No matter how much technology advances,
A warm meal Mom makes,
A heartfelt conversation shared with a friend,
Time the family laughed together,

These things will be your life's real treasures.

So invest time in relationships.
Even if it's not efficient.
Even if AI can give faster answers.

Meet people.
Talk looking in their eyes.
Laugh together, and sometimes cry together.

That's living as a human.

---

**Third, don't forget nature.**

We're spending more and more time in the digital world.

But remember.
We're still part of nature.

We need sunlight,
We need fresh air,
We need the feel of stepping on soil.

Remember what Grandma often says?

"Go outside and play. Get some sun."

You might have thought at first "Grandma says that because she's old-fashioned."

But Grandma's right.

Because our minds are different
When we're in front of screens versus
When we walk in forests.

Our brains, our bodies evolved in nature.
We've lived hearing birdsong, feeling wind, seeing stars.

If we completely lose that, we lose something important.

So go outside every day, even a little.
Look at the sky.
Touch trees.
Put your hands in soil.

That will restore you from digital world fatigue.

---

**Fourth, create meaning.**

AI gives information.
But you create meaning.

What is the meaning of your lives?

Dad can't decide that for you.
AI can't decide it either.

You must find it yourselves.

Some people find meaning in art.
Some find it in science.
Some find it in helping others.

What about you?

It's okay to find it slowly.
It's okay to spend a lifetime searching.

But keep asking.

"What really matters to me?"
"Why am I doing this?"
"What meaning will my life have?"

Don't lose those questions.

Because those questions are precisely what
Make you not simply functioning people
But people living meaningfully.

---

**Finally, don't lose courage.**

You'll experience many changes ahead.

Technology more amazing than AI might emerge.
The world might become completely different from now.

You might be scared each time.
You might be anxious.
You might doubt "Will I be okay?"

Each time, remember.

That you have courage.

The courage of Grandma's generation rising from war's ruins,
The courage of Grandpa's generation overcoming poverty,
The courage of Mom and Dad's generation creating a new world,

That courage flows in you too.

You can do it.

You can learn.
You can create.
You can work.
You can love.
You can make meaning.

Because you're human.

Because you're beings with dignity and possibility unique to humans
That no amount of AI advancement can take away.

---

## Dad's Final Promise

Dear Emma, Noah, and Sophia.

As I finish this book, Dad promises you.

Dad is always on your side.

When you challenge something new,
When you fail,
When you lose your way,
When you feel alone,

Dad will be here.

Dad doesn't know all the answers either.
In this rapidly changing world, Dad is learning too.

But one thing is certain.

We're together.

We'll learn together,
Grow together,
Navigate this new world together.

And someday, when you become adults,
You'll have these conversations with your children.

Then you'll know.

That the greatest gift a parent can give a child
Isn't perfect answers,
But the courage to question and search together.

---

The night deepens, and this letter approaches its end.

Looking out the window, I see stars shining.

Those stars have been shining the same way for thousands, tens of thousands of years.
Before humans discovered fire,
Before we invented writing,
Before we created computers.

And they'll keep shining ahead.
Whether AI advances more,
Whether new technologies emerge.

Much changes,
But some things don't change.

Like stars.
Like love.
Like human dignity.

I hope you'll remember.

Technology changes.
The world changes.
But your value doesn't change.

You deserve to be loved.
You deserve to be respected.
You deserve to be happy.

Simply because you are you.

Not because you're faster, smarter, or more capable than AI.
Simply because you exist.

Thank you for being born into this world.
Thank you for becoming Dad's children.
Thank you for walking this journey together.

You are Dad's pride.

I love you, Emma.
I love you, Noah.
I love you, Sophia.

And to all parents reading this book,
The same is true of your children.

Our children will be okay.

Because they have
Our love,
Their own courage,
And us walking alongside them.

---

2 AM.
The stars still shine,
And you're all fast asleep.

Tomorrow morning when you wake,
Dad will say this:

"Good morning! What will we learn today? What will we make? What adventures will we have?"

And we'll start another day.

In this new world living with AI,
Still humanly,
Still with love,
Still holding hope.

One step, one step.

Together.

---

With love,

Dad

2025, in the heart of the AI era
On a night when stars still shine
