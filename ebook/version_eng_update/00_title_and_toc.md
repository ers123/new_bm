## A Parent's Guide from Korea's Education Frontlines

*How to Nurture Critical Thinking When Machines Have All the Answers*

### About This Book

In 2026, artificial intelligence isn't coming—it's already here. Your children are using ChatGPT for homework, their teachers are integrating AI into classrooms, and the job market they'll enter looks nothing like the one you prepared for.

This book offers a different perspective. Written by a Korean parent with graduate training in public policy and decision science, it draws from one of the world's most intense education cultures to answer a universal question: **How do we raise children who can think for themselves when AI can think for them?**

The answer isn't about restricting technology or racing to master it. It's about developing what I call the "Atom of Thoughts"—the fundamental building blocks of reasoning that no machine can replicate.
