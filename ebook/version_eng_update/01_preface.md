# Preface: A Letter from Seoul

It's 11 PM on a Thursday in Seoul's Gangnam district. Through the window of my apartment, I can see the lights of dozens of hagwons—private academies—still blazing. Somewhere down there, thousands of teenagers are grinding through practice exams, their parents having paid premium rates for instructors who promise an edge in the college entrance wars.

I know this world intimately. I grew up in it. My children are navigating it now.

But tonight, my daughter isn't at a hagwon. She's at our kitchen table, having a conversation with Claude about the French Revolution. Not asking for answers—arguing. Pushing back on the AI's interpretation of Robespierre's motivations. Demanding sources. Getting frustrated when the reasoning doesn't satisfy her.

This is the scene that prompted this book.

## The Question Every Parent Is Asking

When I tell other parents about moments like this, I get two reactions. Some are horrified: "You're letting AI do her homework?" Others are fascinated: "How did you teach her to use it like that?"

Both reactions miss the point. The question isn't whether our children will use AI—they already are, whether we permit it or not. The question is whether they'll use it as a crutch or as a catalyst.

I wrote this book because I believe we're asking the wrong questions about AI and education. We debate screen time limits and plagiarism detection when we should be asking: **What does it mean to think well in an age when machines can think for us?**

## Why Korea? Why Me?

You might wonder why a book about AI parenting comes from Korea, and why you should listen to someone who isn't a tech executive or education professor.

Let me address the second question first. I'm a parent of three children, ages 8, 12, and 16. I hold graduate degrees in public policy and decision science from institutions in the English-speaking world. My professional life has been spent analyzing how people make choices under uncertainty—which, it turns out, is excellent preparation for both parenting and thinking about AI.

As for why Korea: we are the world's laboratory for educational intensity. Korean parents spend more on private education per capita than any country on Earth. Our children study longer hours, face more competitive exams, and experience more pressure than almost anywhere else. If you want to understand where education optimization leads—both its achievements and its pathologies—Korea is the place to look.

But here's what makes this moment different. For decades, Korean parents pursued a specific formula: more hours, more tutoring, more test prep. That formula is breaking. AI doesn't care how many hagwon hours you logged. It doesn't care about your memorization skills. It can outperform any human on the very tasks Korean education has optimized for.

This is forcing Korean parents—the world's most dedicated education optimizers—to ask fundamental questions we've avoided for decades. Not "how do we study harder?" but "what should we even be studying?" Not "how do we get into the best university?" but "what will matter once we get there?"

## What This Book Offers

This isn't a book about restricting technology. I'm not going to tell you to limit screen time or ban ChatGPT from your household. That ship has sailed.

This isn't a book about racing to adopt technology either. I'm not going to convince you that your five-year-old needs to learn prompt engineering.

Instead, this book offers a framework—what I call the "Atom of Thoughts"—for developing the kind of thinking that remains valuable regardless of how AI evolves. It draws on:

- **Decision science research** on how humans actually reason (and where we go wrong)
- **Korean education experience**—both what works and what we've learned fails
- **Practical experiments** from my own family's journey with AI
- **Emerging research** from institutions studying AI-human collaboration

Each chapter ends with concrete exercises you can try with your children. Not because I believe in homework for parents, but because thinking is a practice, not a concept. You can't read your way to better reasoning any more than you can read your way to physical fitness.

## A Note on Humility

I should be honest about what I don't know.

I don't know what the job market will look like when my eight-year-old graduates from college. I don't know which AI capabilities will emerge next year, let alone next decade. I don't know whether the specific approaches in this book will prove optimal—I only know they're better than the alternatives I've seen.

What I do know is that the parents who wait for certainty before acting will wait forever. We're all improvising. The best we can do is improvise thoughtfully, adjust as we learn, and share what we discover.

That's what this book represents: not a final answer, but a serious attempt to think through questions that every parent is facing, from someone who has been thinking about them intensely, in one of the most intense educational environments on Earth.

## How to Read This Book

You don't have to read this book in order. If you're dealing with an immediate situation—your teenager is using ChatGPT to write essays, say—skip to Chapter 7. If you're more interested in the long-term vision, start with Part IV.

But if you have the patience, I'd encourage you to read Part II (The Framework) carefully. The "Atom of Thoughts" concept isn't complicated, but it requires shifting how you think about thinking. That shift makes everything else in the book more useful.

One more suggestion: read this book with your children when they're old enough (roughly 12 and up). The conversations that emerge from discussing these ideas together are often more valuable than the ideas themselves.

## The Stakes

I want to end this preface with something personal.

When I watch my daughter argue with an AI at the kitchen table, I feel something I rarely felt during my own education: hope. Not because the technology is impressive—though it is—but because of what the interaction reveals about her. She's not intimidated by the machine. She's not subservient to it. She treats it as a thinking partner that happens to have more information but not necessarily better judgment.

That stance—confident engagement without naive acceptance—is what I want for all three of my children. It's what I want for your children too.

The stakes are high. Raise children who defer to AI, and they'll be displaced by it. Raise children who reject AI, and they'll be outcompeted by those who embrace it. But raise children who can think with AI—critically, creatively, independently—and they'll be prepared for whatever comes.

That's the goal of this book. Let's get started.
