# Chapter 11: What Universities Will Look For in 2035

## The Day the Formula Died

In 2024, MIT made an announcement that sent shockwaves through the Korean parent community: they were eliminating consideration of legacy status and standardized test scores from their admission process. Stanford followed. Then Yale. One by one, the elite institutions that Korean parents had spent decades—and fortunes—trying to crack announced that the old rules no longer applied.

The response in Korea was panic. I watched as WhatsApp groups exploded with questions: "If not test scores, then what?" "How do we prepare our children if we don't know what they're looking for?" "This isn't fair—at least with tests, everyone knew the rules."

But buried in that panic was a more interesting question: What were universities actually trying to find, now that they'd abandoned the metrics that were easy to optimize for?

The answer, when you read the fine print, was surprisingly consistent across institutions: they wanted evidence of genuine intellectual engagement, authentic achievement, and demonstrated capacity for original thought.

In other words, exactly what the Korean test-prep industrial complex was optimized to eliminate.

## The Death of the Application Formula

For decades, elite university admission followed a rough formula that tutoring companies had reverse-engineered with impressive precision:

**Academic:** Top grades + Top test scores + AP/IB courses
**Extracurricular:** Leadership positions + Community service + One "spike" activity
**Essays:** Compelling personal narrative + Evidence of "growth"
**Recommendations:** Enthusiastic + Specific anecdotes

This formula was trainable. Parents could—and did—invest enormous resources to manufacture each component. Test prep raised scores. Strategic activity selection created the appearance of diverse engagement. Essay coaches crafted compelling narratives from whatever raw material existed. The system was gameable, and the game was being played at industrial scale.

But universities knew this. They've known it for years. The formula was getting them applicants who were extraordinarily good at playing the admission game—but not necessarily extraordinary in ways that predicted academic or life success.

The shift we're witnessing isn't random. It's a deliberate response to the gaming. And AI has accelerated it dramatically.

When AI can write college essays that are indistinguishable from (or better than) human-written ones, the essay becomes meaningless as an evaluation tool—unless you change what you're looking for. When AI can help anyone create polished project portfolios, the portfolio matters less than the demonstrated ability to do something AI can't help with.

The new admission landscape rewards exactly what can't be faked, manufactured, or outsourced to AI.

## What "Game-Changers" Actually Look Like

I've had the opportunity to speak with admission officers from several elite universities—off the record—about what actually catches their attention now. The patterns are instructive.

### Pattern 1: Evidence of Genuine Obsession

Not "well-rounded" engagement in many activities, but deep, sustained, intrinsically-motivated exploration of something the applicant genuinely cares about.

One admission officer described it this way: "We can tell the difference between 'I did this because it looks good' and 'I did this because I couldn't not do it.' The first category is huge. The second is rare and obvious when you see it."

**What this looks like:**
- Years of sustained engagement, not strategic rotation through activities
- Evidence of self-directed learning beyond any curriculum
- Original projects or research that no one assigned
- Depth of knowledge that shows up in interviews and writing

**What this doesn't look like:**
- A list of impressive-sounding activities with no connecting thread
- Perfect execution of whatever is currently considered impressive
- Optimization for admission rather than genuine interest

### Pattern 2: Intellectual Risk-Taking

Applicants who have attempted something difficult—and possibly failed—stand out from those who have carefully curated success.

"We're looking for students who will push themselves here," one officer told me. "A perfect application sometimes suggests someone who's never been in a situation they couldn't handle. That's not who thrives in our environment."

**What this looks like:**
- Projects that didn't work and what was learned from them
- Intellectual positions that were later revised
- Engagement with material beyond comfort zone
- Evidence of changing one's mind based on evidence

**What this doesn't look like:**
- Airbrushed narratives of uninterrupted success
- Strategic challenges that were guaranteed to succeed
- Avoidance of any situation that might produce failure

### Pattern 3: Independent Thinking

Not contrarianism for its own sake, but evidence that the applicant can form and defend their own views.

"AI can argue any position," one officer noted. "We're looking for evidence that this human has thought for themselves—not just absorbed whatever they've been taught or whatever AI suggested."

**What this looks like:**
- Essays that take genuine positions and defend them
- Interview responses that reflect personal thinking, not rehearsed answers
- Recommendations that describe specific intellectual contributions
- Academic work that shows original analysis, not just synthesis

**What this doesn't look like:**
- Essays that could have been written by anyone
- Views that perfectly match expected "elite" positions
- Thinking that seems entirely derivative of others

### Pattern 4: Impact Beyond Self

Not manufactured "community service," but genuine engagement with the world beyond oneself.

"We're tired of volunteer trips that cost $5,000 and helped no one except the volunteer's application," one officer said bluntly. "Show me that you did something that made a real difference, and show me that you understood the complexity involved."

**What this looks like:**
- Local engagement, not exotic tourism
- Long-term commitment, not episodic participation
- Evidence of learning from the experience, including mistakes
- Genuine relationships, not transactional interactions

**What this doesn't look like:**
- Strategic charity designed for application optics
- Leadership positions in organizations that accomplish nothing
- Impressive-sounding but actually meaningless initiatives

## Skills Over Credentials: The Portfolio Generation

The shift from credentials to skills is already happening, and it will accelerate dramatically by 2035.

Credentials—degrees, test scores, certifications—are easy to verify but increasingly easy to obtain without genuine competence. In the age of AI, the credential-competence gap will only widen.

Skills—the actual ability to do things—are harder to verify but harder to fake. When someone can demonstrate genuine capability, the credential becomes less important.

This shift has profound implications for how children should spend their time:

### The Old Model
1. Accumulate credentials (grades, test scores, awards)
2. Use credentials to access opportunities (college admission, job interviews)
3. Demonstrate skills on the job (if you have them)

### The Emerging Model
1. Develop genuine skills through practice and projects
2. Build portfolio evidence of those skills
3. Skills open doors; credentials become secondary

### Building Your Child's Evidence Portfolio

Rather than focusing on credential accumulation, help your child build a portfolio of evidence that demonstrates genuine capability. Here's how:

**Documentation Habit:** Train children to document their work consistently. Not just final products, but process—sketches, drafts, failures, iterations. This creates a record of genuine engagement that can't be faked after the fact.

**Project-Based Learning:** Encourage substantial projects that produce real outputs. These become portfolio pieces. An essay about caring about climate change is worth nothing. A year-long analysis of local air quality data, with methodology, findings, and limitations, is evidence of real capability.

**Public Work:** When appropriate, encourage children to put work in public—blogs, open-source contributions, published research, community projects. Public work creates a verifiable record and invites feedback that improves future work.

**Reflection Practice:** After significant projects, have children write reflections: What worked? What didn't? What would you do differently? What did you learn? This metacognitive practice produces material for applications while developing genuine learning capacity.

**Skill Stacking:** Help children develop unique combinations of skills. AI expertise + visual design + climate science creates different opportunities than AI expertise alone. The intersections become their distinctive positioning.

## What Universities Can't See (And Why It Matters)

Here's something admission officers don't like to admit: their ability to evaluate applicants is fundamentally limited. They have 10-15 minutes to review each application. They're making probabilistic bets based on incomplete information.

This limitation shapes what they look for. They seek signals—markers that predict success without requiring them to verify everything directly.

Understanding this helps parents and children make strategic decisions:

**High-Signal Activities:** Activities where engagement can be verified and where exceptional performance is rare. Independent research, published work, competition results in demanding fields.

**Low-Signal Activities:** Activities where the gap between appearing engaged and being engaged is easily bridged. Generic volunteer work, common extracurriculars, leadership titles that anyone could hold.

**Signal Amplification:** Ways to make genuine engagement more visible. Documentation, public work, third-party validation, long-term commitment.

**Signal Contamination:** Ways that legitimate engagement gets dismissed as gaming. Following currently-popular formulas too closely, strategic timing of activities, overproduced applications.

The goal isn't to become a signal-optimization machine. It's to ensure that genuine engagement produces the signals that will be recognized, rather than being invisible to an evaluation process with severe limitations.

## The 2035 Application: A Projection

Based on current trends, here's what I expect the elite university application to look like in 2035:

### What Will Be Required

**AI-Verified Portfolio:** Applicants will submit a portfolio of work over time. AI systems will verify authenticity, check for AI-generated content, and analyze development trajectories. The question won't be "is this good?" but "did this person actually create it, and does their work show genuine growth?"

**Real-Time Assessment:** Some form of live evaluation—interview, problem-solving session, or discussion—that AI can observe but not fake. Institutions want to see how minds actually work, not polished outputs.

**Long-Term Engagement Records:** Rather than a snapshot of activities at application time, universities will want to see sustained engagement records. Blockchain or similar technology may verify consistent involvement over years.

**Adversarial Questions:** Expect evaluation components specifically designed to be hard for AI to assist with: novel problems, genuine debates, demonstrations of tacit knowledge.

### What Will Be Deemphasized

**Standardized Test Scores:** Already declining in importance, likely to become fully optional or eliminated at most institutions.

**Polished Essays:** When AI writes better than most humans, the polished essay becomes meaningless. Expect a shift to real-time writing samples or AI-verified authentic writing over time.

**Activity Lists:** The list of activities will matter less than demonstrated engagement with a few activities.

**Manufactured Narratives:** The "personal growth story" that essay coaches craft will be recognizable as a genre that anyone can produce. Authenticity will beat polish.

### What Will Matter Most

**Evidence of Original Thought:** Can this person think in ways AI can't? Do they ask questions that haven't been asked, make connections that aren't obvious, challenge assumptions others accept?

**Demonstrated Learning Capacity:** Not what you know now, but evidence that you learn quickly and well. In a fast-changing world, this matters more than existing knowledge.

**Authentic Engagement:** Did this person do things because they cared about them, or because they were optimizing for evaluation?

**Real Impact:** Did this person make something happen in the world beyond their own advancement?

## Practical Guidance: The 10-Year Runway

If your child is 8 years old today and heading for college applications in 2035, here's how to think about the next decade:

### Years 1-3 (Ages 8-10): Exploration Phase

**Goal:** Help your child discover genuine interests through broad exposure.

**Actions:**
- Expose them to many domains without pressure to excel in any
- Notice what captures sustained attention
- Let interests emerge rather than engineering them
- Document what excites them, even casually

**Avoid:**
- Declaring "this is your thing" too early
- Optimizing activities for future applications
- Treating every activity as credential-building

### Years 4-6 (Ages 11-13): Development Phase

**Goal:** Deepen engagement in areas of genuine interest.

**Actions:**
- When interest emerges, provide resources to go deeper
- Introduce project-based thinking: "What could you make or do with this interest?"
- Begin documentation habits
- Connect them with mentors or communities in their interest areas

**Avoid:**
- Forcing pivot to "more impressive" interests
- Over-structuring their exploration
- Comparing their trajectory to others

### Years 7-9 (Ages 14-16): Production Phase

**Goal:** Turn engagement into tangible outputs and genuine expertise.

**Actions:**
- Support substantial projects that produce real outputs
- Help make their work visible (appropriate to the work)
- Encourage intellectual risk-taking
- Begin building verifiable record of sustained engagement

**Avoid:**
- Optimizing for what currently looks good on applications
- Letting fear of failure prevent ambitious attempts
- Treating every project as an application strategy

### Year 10 (Ages 17-18): Articulation Phase

**Goal:** Help your child present their genuine trajectory honestly and compellingly.

**Actions:**
- Review the record they've built
- Help them see patterns they might have missed
- Support authentic articulation of who they are and what they care about
- Trust the process—the foundation work has been done

**Avoid:**
- Last-minute manufacturing of credentials
- Distorting their story to fit perceived formulas
- Panic-driven strategies that undermine authenticity

## The Paradox of Preparation

Here's the deepest truth about preparing for a future we can't predict:

The best preparation isn't trying to optimize for what universities want. It's raising a child who develops genuine interests, thinks independently, persists through difficulty, and engages authentically with the world.

If you do that well, the "application" will essentially write itself—it will be an honest account of a genuinely interesting young person.

If you try to manufacture the application—engineering activities, crafting narratives, optimizing every decision for evaluation—you'll produce exactly what universities are learning to see through and screen out.

The parents who are most anxious about their children's futures often make choices that undermine those futures. The pressure to perform produces performers. The obsession with credentials produces credential-optimizers. The gaming of the system produces gamers.

What universities want—what the world needs—are young people who care about something beyond their own advancement, think in ways AI can't replicate, and engage authentically with challenges.

Raise that kind of child.

The rest will follow.

## A Note to Korean Parents

I write this as someone who understands the Korean education context intimately. I know the pressure. I know the stakes feel existential. I know that backing off the optimization treadmill feels like abandoning your child.

But the world is changing. The rules your parents followed to get you where you are—they don't apply the same way to your children. The formula that worked is being actively disrupted by the institutions you're trying to access.

You can keep running the old playbook and watch your children compete in a game that's being discontinued. Or you can trust them to develop as genuine thinkers and authentic humans, which is what the new game rewards.

This isn't about working less hard. It's about working differently.

Not optimizing for signals, but developing genuine capability.
Not manufacturing credentials, but building evidence of real engagement.
Not gaming the system, but becoming someone the system would want anyway.

That's harder in some ways. It requires trusting a process you can't fully control.

But it's also more aligned with what we actually want for our children: not admission to a particular institution, but a life of genuine intellectual engagement, authentic achievement, and meaningful contribution.

The universities of 2035 will be looking for that.

More importantly, the world of 2035 will need it.
