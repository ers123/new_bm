### Opening Section (Emotional Hook)

Does this sound familiar?

📱 Your child asks AI for homework answers **before even trying**
🤖 They accept AI's response **without asking "why?"**
💭 They're gradually **losing the muscle of independent thinking**

Your concern is valid.
Today's children need something more than coding skills—
they need **the mental strength to thrive in the AI age**.

### 📚 About the Author

**Sungha (HarmonyOn)**

Father of three children and practitioner at the intersection of education and technology.

The concern that began from watching his children depend on AI tutors evolved into a fundamental question:
*"Does technology steal our children's ability to think, or enhance it?"*

Through years of observation, experimentation, and trial-and-error with his three children,
he has found a path where technology and humanity meet harmoniously in education.

This book is the fruit of that journey—
a sincere compass offered to all parents and educators sharing the same concerns.

The Future of Parenting in the AI Era: A Korean Perspective

As a father of three navigating technology and education, I've wrestled with a fundamental question:

"In an age where AI provides all answers, how do we raise children who ask the right questions?"

Today I'm launching my book (Korean, English translation planned for 2025):
「How to Raise Children in the AI Era」

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

What This Addresses:

🔹 AI dependency in children's learning
🔹 Critical thinking in the information age
🔹 Practical AI literacy frameworks for families
🔹 Balancing technology with human development
🔹 Preparing for careers that don't exist yet

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Who Should Read:

✓ Parents of school-age children
✓ Educators reimagining pedagogy for AI
✓ EdTech professionals and leaders
✓ Anyone concerned about learning's future

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

What Makes This Different:

Unlike purely technical guides, this combines:
- Real parenting experience (three children, ages 7-15)
- Educational research and frameworks
- 10 practical, implementable guides
- A Korean cultural perspective

The epilogue—a father's 2 AM letter to his sleeping children about their AI-shaped future—is worth the read alone.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Launch Offer:

Special: $11 USD
Regular: $15 USD
Limited to first 100 buyers
